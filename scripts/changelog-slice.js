/**
 * Pick the slice of the fork changelog that ships inside the bundle.
 *
 * The what's-new popup shows what changed since the last update, and
 * `CHANGELOG.md` is where that is already written — so the build embeds a piece
 * of it as a virtual module (see `changelogPlugin` in `rollup.config.js`).
 *
 * The piece has to be chosen carefully. The fork's `## Unreleased — branch
 * main` heading is never rotated: release-please manages the `## [x.y.z]`
 * sections *below* it, and nothing ever moves entries out of the unreleased
 * body, so it holds every change since the fork diverged — hundreds of entries
 * and hundreds of kilobytes. Embedding a fixed number of *characters* of that
 * cuts mid-sentence and still shows many releases' worth of history under a
 * heading that claims one release.
 *
 * So the slice is counted in entries, not characters: whole `###` entries, as
 * many as it takes to cover the last {@link DEFAULT_RELEASES_BACK} releases,
 * with caps on both entries and characters kept as backstops. When entries are
 * left out the slice says so in one line, so the panel ends deliberately rather
 * than just stopping.
 *
 * Release boundaries are what makes "as many as it takes" answerable. A release
 * stamps `<!-- shipped in x.y.z -->` under the unreleased heading
 * (`scripts/stamp-changelog-version.js`), so the markers say where each release
 * began and the slice can ship down to the one that serves a player some number
 * of releases behind. The markers ride along in what ships, because the panel
 * narrows the slice again at run time to the entries newer than the build the
 * player was running — a question the build cannot answer, since it does not
 * know who is asking. Markers are comments: they are not entries, they do not
 * count against the entry cap, and the panel strips them before drawing.
 *
 * This lives outside `rollup.config.js` so it can be tested directly: it is the
 * only part of the plugin with any judgement in it.
 */

/**
 * How many releases back the slice tries to serve.
 *
 * Marker semantics decide the arithmetic: the marker for a version sits *above*
 * the entries that shipped in it, so serving a player who last ran version V
 * means shipping every entry above V's marker, and V's marker with them. Five
 * releases back is therefore the marker at index 5, counting the release being
 * built as 0 — it covers a player who has missed several releases in a row, not
 * just the one who updated normally.
 *
 * Two releases back used to be the answer, sized to what the popup could show
 * on one screen. Now that the popup paginates (`whats-new.js`), the limit that
 * matters is bundle weight, not screen space, and the entry/character caps
 * below are what actually bound that — this knob just says how far the release
 * boundaries themselves should reach before those caps take over. Five covers
 * the entry cap's 120 several times over on a typical day (measured against
 * `CHANGELOG.md`: five releases back is ~145 entries, so the 120-entry cap
 * binds first), so the caps, not this number, decide what ships on a busy
 * stretch. Someone further behind than this still sees the whole slice, with
 * the omission line saying that there is more.
 */

/**
 * The floor, and the answer when there is nothing better.
 *
 * Also exactly what the slice shipped before it could read markers, which is
 * the point: an unmarked changelog — every build until the first marked release
 * merges, and any hand-built one after that — has no release boundary to slice
 * on and falls back to this, unchanged. It doubles as the minimum for a quiet
 * release, so two one-line releases in a row cannot leave a player who is
 * further behind staring at a two-item list.

/**
 * Bundle-sharing check.
 *
 * The production build splits the script into several iife bundles, and any
 * `src/utils/**` module that two bundles both reach is silently copied into
 * each of them unless `rollup.config.js` declares it external (the
 * `utilsExternalGlobals` map) and `src/libraries/utils.js` exports it. Two
 * copies means divergent state — the config's own comments record the
 * casualties (duplicated watch timers, stale geometry caches, a second toast
 * stack) — and nothing used to notice until a panel misbehaved.
 *
 * The same hazard exists for `src/core/**`, whose modules are constructed
 * singletons meant to be reached through `Toolasha.Core.*` — a second copy
 * there registers a second set of WebSocket/DOM observers and runs a second
 * state machine.
 *
 * This script makes the rule executable: it walks the static import graph from
 * every production bundle entry, using the same `external` predicates the
 * build itself uses, and fails loudly on any module under a policed prefix
 * (see POLICED_PREFIXES) that ends up bundled inline into two or more bundles
 * without being allowlisted.
 *
 * What "inline" means here: a module an `external` predicate exempts is not
 * traversed for that bundle — it arrives at runtime through the shared
 * `Toolasha.*` global, which is the whole point. A module the predicate does
 * not exempt is compiled into the bundle, so reaching it from two bundles is
 * two copies.
 *
 * Deliberately out of scope:
 * - `?worker` imports: a Web Worker is its own realm with no `window.Toolasha`,
 *   so its graph is bundled inline per worker by design and cannot share.
 * - `?raw` imports: CSS text, no graph behind it.
 * - bare specifiers (node_modules): vendored per bundle on purpose; only
 *   `src/utils/**` sharing is this script's business.
 * - `rollup.config.enhancement.js`: the standalone enhancement build is a
 *   separate script, not one of the cooperating production bundles.
 *
 * Run standalone: `node scripts/check-bundle-sharing.mjs`
 * Wired into: `npm run build` (runs before rollup).

/**
 * Combat Simulator Library
 *
 * The battle engine, on its own.
 *
 * It is by a wide margin the largest thing in the script — about a megabyte of
 * source, roughly half of what the combat bundle used to be — and four features
 * across three bundles reach into it: the labyrinth clear-rate model, task
 * profit, the build score, and the simulator's own interface.
 *
 * Bundled with each of them it was **copied into each of them**, which is how
 * the combat and UI bundles both ended up within a few kilobytes of the 2 MB
 * ceiling while carrying the same `Monster` class twice over. Here it is loaded
 * once and referenced.
 *
 * Exports to: window.Toolasha.Sim

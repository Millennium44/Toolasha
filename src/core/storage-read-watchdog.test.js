/**
 * The read watchdog.
 *
 * Every read in `storage.js` settles from an event on its own request or its
 * transaction. That covers every way IndexedDB *reports* a failure and none of
 * the ways it reports nothing at all: a connection that stops delivering events
 * leaves the promise pending for the life of the page, nothing throws, nothing
 * is logged, and a startup that sits behind the settings read never happens.
 * That is the 3.47.0 report — startup stopped between `settings:storageReady`
 * and `features:start` with an empty error log.
 *
 * What these tests do and do not cover. They drive the real `Storage` class
 * against hand-rolled fake IDB objects, in the same style as `storage.test.js`,
 * so they prove the *module's* behaviour: that a read which never gets an event
 * still settles, says so with the key and the store in the message, reopens the
 * connection, and prefers a retry on the new connection over answering with a
 * default. They prove nothing about IndexedDB itself — no fake reproduces a
 * browser wedging a live connection, and no test here shows what wedged the
 * connection in the live tab.

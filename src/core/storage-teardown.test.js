/**
 * Giving the IndexedDB connection back when the page goes away.
 *
 * The live failure, on 3.47.0: a tab was refreshed twice in quick succession,
 * and from then on every read of the `settings` store hung — in that tab and in
 * every other tab on the origin — while reads of every other store on the same
 * connection answered in milliseconds. Reloading the broken tab changed nothing;
 * reloading the *other* tabs fixed it instantly. That is a readwrite transaction
 * on `settings` left outstanding by a torn-down page: IndexedDB serialises
 * transactions per object store across every connection on the origin, so one
 * orphan holds that store everywhere until the connection holding it is gone.
 * The unload flush opened those transactions and nothing ever called
 * `db.close()`.
 *
 * What these tests do and do not prove. They drive the real `Storage` class
 * against hand-rolled fake IDB objects, in the style of `storage.test.js`, so
 * they prove the *mechanism this change adds*: that a flush and a close both
 * happen on teardown, in that order, that the close does not cut the flush's
 * transactions short, that nothing reopens a connection on a page that is
 * leaving, and that a page which comes back gets a working database. They prove
 * nothing about IndexedDB itself — no fake reproduces a browser holding a store
 * across connections, and nothing in vitest reproduces a double refresh. The
 * live evidence above is what establishes the cause; this establishes the
 * mechanism.

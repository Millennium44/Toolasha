 * Soft per-store key-count budgets.
 *
 * Not a limit the database enforces — nothing here refuses a write. It is the
 * number above which a store has stopped being a rolling window and started
 * being a leak, which is a thing worth saying in a diagnostic report before the
 * quota says it for us. Only stores that grow with play are listed; anything
 * absent is unbudgeted and simply reported without a verdict.
 *
 * Three of these budgets were raised when their recorders stopped keeping their
 * history in one key and started keeping it in one record per time bucket (see
 * `utils/chunked-history.js`). The key count went up and the bytes written per
 * event went down by two or three orders of magnitude, which is the trade the
 * budget is here to permit rather than to flag — a store of many small records
 * is not the leak this number looks for.
 *
 * The budgets marked "Per character" below are sized for one character's worst
 * case, not the account's. `budgetReport()` compares them against a
 * per-character count for exactly those stores (see its `perCharacterCount`
 * parameter) — a flat count of every key in the store would add every
 * character's chunks together, tripping the budget for any multi-character
 * account well before any one of them is actually over it.

 * `budgetReport` swaps the busiest character's count in for the store total.
 * `marketListings` is mixed: the trade ledger writes one
 * `tradeLedgerRec_<charId>_<YYYY-MM-DD>` record per character per trading day,
 * beside account-wide market caches that have nothing to do with a character.
 * Counting both against one flat number is the bug 882023aec fixed for the
 * chunked stores, latent here — a four-character account with a shared 2,000
 * trips the store budget while no single character is near its own — and
 * swapping the whole row to a per-character count would stop the account-wide
 * caches being watched at all. So the store keeps its flat row and gains a
 * second one for the family.
 *
 * `family` is the key prefix, and the count comes from the caller's
 * `perCharacterCount` — which is the maximum over every character-scoped
 * prefix registered for the store, so this is only exact while a store has one
 * such family. `marketListings` does.

     * The failure this exists to prevent, measured live on 3.47.0: a tab was
     * refreshed twice in quick succession, and from then on every read of the
     * `settings` store hung — in that tab and in every other tab on the origin —
     * while reads of every other store on the same connection answered in
     * milliseconds. Reloading the broken tab changed nothing; reloading the
     * *other* tabs fixed it instantly. That is a readwrite transaction on
     * `settings` left outstanding by a torn-down page: IndexedDB serialises
     * transactions per object store across every connection on the origin, so
     * one orphan blocks that store everywhere until the connection holding it
     * goes away. Nothing in this module ever told a connection to go away.
     *
     * `close()` is the lever, and the shape matters more than the call:
     *
     * - The flush is started but **not** awaited, and `close()` is called in the
     *   same task. `flushAll()` opens its transactions synchronously when there
     *   is nothing in flight, so by the time `close()` runs they exist — and
     *   `close()` does not abort them. It sets the connection's close-pending
     *   flag: no *new* transaction may be started on it, and the browser
     *   finalises and releases it as soon as the outstanding ones finish.
     *   Awaiting the flush first would be tidier and would also be a promise
     *   this method cannot keep: on a real unload the page may not live long
     *   enough to resume from an `await`, which is precisely the case that left
     *   the orphan. Marking the connection close-pending is the part that has to
     *   happen synchronously, and it is the part that is worth having.
     * - The handlers are cleared first. `onclose` would otherwise call
     *   `_reconnect()` and open a fresh connection on a page that is leaving —
     *   the exact thing this is preventing. (A deliberate `close()` does not
     *   fire `onclose` in a compliant browser; this does not depend on that.)
     * - `_closingForTeardown` stops `_awaitConnection` reopening for the same
     *   reason. Writes that flushAll had not yet opened a transaction for are
     *   reported as failed and stay queued; on a page that is being destroyed
     *   that costs nothing, and on a page that comes back (see
     *   `reopenAfterRestore`) they are still in `pendingWrites` and are written
     *   by the next flush.
     *
     * This is the `pagehide` handler's business only. `beforeunload` may be
     * cancelled and `visibilitychange` says nothing about the page ending — see
     * the listener block in `entrypoint.js` for why each of the three differs.

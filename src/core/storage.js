 * absent is unbudgeted and simply reported without a verdict.
 *
 * Three of these budgets were raised when their recorders stopped keeping their
 * history in one key and started keeping it in one record per time bucket (see
 * `utils/chunked-history.js`). The key count went up and the bytes written per
 * event went down by two or three orders of magnitude, which is the trade the

/**
 * Initialize all enabled features
 *
 * Returns what failed rather than only logging it. An initializer that throws
 * used to reach the player as a feature that is simply absent, with the reason
 * in a console nobody has open; the caller needs the list to be able to say so.
 *
 * Features are initialized in registry order and each is awaited before the next
 * one starts, *unless* its registry entry sets `concurrent: true`. Such a
 * feature is still started in its turn — its synchronous half runs at exactly
 * the same point it always did — but the waiting is deferred to the end, so its
 * `await` overlaps everything after it instead of delaying it.
 *
 * Why that is worth a flag. Almost none of feature startup is our own CPU: six
 * features between them spent 2.9 s inside `initialize()` and half a millisecond
 * of it running code, the rest parked on an IndexedDB read that nothing else
 * wanted. Awaited one after another those reads add up; overlapped, the group
 * costs what its slowest member costs.
 *
 * Why it is opt-in rather than the default. Serial initialization is load-bearing
 * in places that are not obvious from the registry: tooltip sections and the
 * task panel's buttons appear in the order their observers were registered,
 * which for a post-`await` registration means the order the reads happened to
 * finish in; and a feature that populates a shared singleton after its await
 * (loadout snapshots, the expected-value calculator) is read by later features
 * that assume it is already full. A feature is safe to mark only when what it
 * awaits is its own — its own storage record, its own panel — and nothing
 * downstream is ordered against what it does afterwards. (The market data
 * load is no longer a reason to serialize: the entrypoint starts the one
 * startup fetch itself and `marketAPI.fetch()` folds concurrent callers onto
 * the in-flight request.)
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Array<{key: string, name: string, reason: string}>>} Failures, in registry order

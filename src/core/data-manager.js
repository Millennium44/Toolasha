     * The close is not kept as the whole recovery because a client that did
     * *not* reconnect would be left with no socket at all, which is worse than

     *   evidenced and not proven, and if it ever fails the player loses the
     *   game connection too — a worse page than the dead one they had. The
     *   player who declined automatic recovery is not the one who should absorb
     *   the risk of the unproven step.
     * - The interaction gate costs nothing to keep and bounds the blast radius:
     *   a page the player has started using is left alone entirely, as today.
     * - The once-per-tab *reload* guard is deliberately NOT inherited. That was
     *   the original rule, on the reasoning that a tab which reloaded and came
     *   back into the same failure is looping. It had it backwards: such a tab

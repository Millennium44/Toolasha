/**
 * Dungeon key cost
 *
 * What one entry key or chest key costs, given that there are two ways to get
 * one: buy it off the market, or craft it from materials.
 *
 * ## Why both numbers, always
 *
 * A dungeon profit figure that prices keys at the market ask is answering "what
 * would it cost me to replace these keys right now, impatiently". That is a
 * real question, but it is not the only one, and when a key's materials are
 * cheaper than the key the answer overstates the cost of running the dungeon —
 * sometimes badly, because keys are thin markets and the ask drifts far above
 * what the recipe implies.
 *
 * So this reports both sides and names the cheaper one rather than picking
 * silently. The caller gets `unitCost` (the cheaper), and `buyPrice`,
 * `craftCost` and `cheaper` next to it, so a display can show the choice it made
 * instead of presenting one number as if it were the only one.
 *
 * ## Time is reported, not priced
 *
 * Crafting a key costs materials *and* time, and the time has no honest gold
 * value — it depends entirely on what the player would otherwise be doing.
 * `craftSeconds` is therefore handed back as seconds and never folded into
 * `craftCost`. A caller that wants to say "cheaper, but it costs you twelve
 * minutes" has what it needs; nothing here invents an hourly wage to make the
 * comparison come out one way.
 *
 * `craftSeconds` is the time for the key's own crafting action, per key, at this
 * character's efficiency. Materials are costed at whichever of buying and
 * crafting is cheaper for them (that is what `computeBestCraftingPlan` decides),
 * so if a material is itself crafted, its time is not in this figure.
 *
 * ## Whose cost this is
 *
 * A crafting cost is personal — artisan tea removes materials, efficiency gives
 * free actions, gear changes the action time. Everything here goes through
 * `describeCraft`, which costs the recipe against the logged-in character, so
 * two players reading the same dungeon get different and correct answers.

 * same way instead of each reading the raw string and indexing a price map with
 * it — which is what `synced` and `craft` would have silently broken, since
 * `prices['craft']` is `undefined` and the `?? prices.ask` fallbacks would have
 * hidden that behind a plausible number.
 *
 * `synced` follows `profitCalc_pricingMode`'s **buy** side through
 * `getPricingMode`, the one authority on that setting. Keys are only ever
 * bought, so the general setting's sell side has nothing to say here.
 *
 * `craft` resolves a market side too: the recipe's materials still have to be
 * priced off one side of the book, and it follows the general setting's buy
 * side for the same reason `synced` does — the user expressed a basis
 * preference there and none here.
 *
 * An unrecognised stored value falls back to `ask` rather than being passed
 * through. Five features value keys through this; a typo in a hand-edited
 * profile must not take all five out.

/**
 * What one key costs, bought and crafted, and which of those the setting takes.
 *
 * Either side may be missing and the result is still usable: a key with no
 * recipe reports `craftCost: null` and settles on buying, a key nobody is
 * selling reports `buyPrice: null` and settles on crafting. When both are
 * missing `unitCost` is null, which is the caller's signal that this key cannot
 * be costed at all rather than that it is free.
 *
 * ## What the basis changes
 *
 * On the `market` basis — every mode but `craft` — `unitCost` is the cheaper of
 * the two, which is what this has always reported and what `ask` and `bid` must
 * keep reporting.
 *
 * On the `craft` basis `unitCost` is the craft cost even when the market is
 * cheaper, because the user has said they make their own keys and wants them
 * valued at what they actually pay. Two things that basis does **not** do:
 *
 * - It never part-prices a recipe. `describeCraft` rejects a recipe outright
 *   when a material has no price, so `craftCost` is null rather than a total
 *   with a free material in it. A missing material is unknown, never zero.
 * - It never leaves a costable key uncosted. When the recipe is missing or
 *   unpriceable the market quote is used instead and `cheaper` reports `'buy'`,
 *   so a display and a net worth both get the honest replacement cost rather
 *   than a null that every `?? 0` downstream would turn into a free key. Only
 *   when the market has nothing either is `unitCost` null.

/**
 * Dungeon key cost
 *
 * What one entry key or chest key costs, given that there are two ways to get
 * one: buy it off the market, or craft it from materials.
 *
 * ## Why both numbers, always
 *
 * A dungeon profit figure that prices keys at the market ask is answering "what
 * would it cost me to replace these keys right now, impatiently". That is a
 * real question, but it is not the only one, and when a key's materials are
 * cheaper than the key the answer overstates the cost of running the dungeon —
 * sometimes badly, because keys are thin markets and the ask drifts far above
 * what the recipe implies.
 *
 * So this reports both sides and names the cheaper one rather than picking
 * silently. The caller gets `unitCost` (the cheaper), and `buyPrice`,
 * `craftCost` and `cheaper` next to it, so a display can show the choice it made
 * instead of presenting one number as if it were the only one.
 *
 * ## Time is reported, not priced
 *
 * Crafting a key costs materials *and* time, and the time has no honest gold
 * value — it depends entirely on what the player would otherwise be doing.
 * `craftSeconds` is therefore handed back as seconds and never folded into
 * `craftCost`. A caller that wants to say "cheaper, but it costs you twelve
 * minutes" has what it needs; nothing here invents an hourly wage to make the
 * comparison come out one way.
 *
 * `craftSeconds` is the time for the key's own crafting action, per key, at this
 * character's efficiency.
 *
 * ## Direct recipe only
 *
 * `craftCost` prices the key's own recipe and nothing below it: every input is
 * bought at the market, never crafted, even when crafting that input would be
 * cheaper. A player who crafts entry keys buys lumber and essence; they do not
 * also fell logs and refine lumber to save a further few percent, and a craft
 * cost that assumed they did was overstating what the key actually costs them
 * by however much cheaper the deepest raw materials were. `describeDirectCraft`
 * (in the crafting-plan feature's arbitrage adapter) does the summing; this
 * module supplies the per-material price. The crafting-plan feature's own
 * recursive planner (`describeCraft` / `computeBestCraftingPlan`) is unchanged
 * and still answers its own question correctly — it is simply not what a key
 * cost uses.
 *
 * A material with no market price at all makes the whole `craftCost` null
 * rather than a total with a free ingredient in it; `describeKeyCost` and
 * `getKeyUnitCost` then fall back to the market price of the key itself, same
 * as a key with no recipe.
 *
 * ## Whose cost this is
 *
 * A crafting cost is personal — artisan tea removes materials, efficiency gives
 * free actions, gear changes the action time. Everything here is costed
 * against the logged-in character, so two players reading the same dungeon get
 * different and correct answers.

/**
 * What one key costs, bought and crafted, and which of those the setting takes.
 *
 * Either side may be missing and the result is still usable: a key with no
 * recipe reports `craftCost: null` and settles on buying, a key nobody is
 * selling reports `buyPrice: null` and settles on crafting. When both are
 * missing `unitCost` is null, which is the caller's signal that this key cannot
 * be costed at all rather than that it is free.
 *
 * ## What the basis changes
 *
 * On the `market` basis — `ask`, `bid`, and `synced` once it has resolved to a
 * side — `unitCost` is the market price of the key, full stop. The user picked
 * a side of the book on purpose; the recipe is never consulted to override it,
 * even when crafting would be cheaper. `craftCost` and `savings` are still
 * computed and returned so a display can *say* crafting would be cheaper, but
 * the number actually charged is the market one. The one exception is a key
 * nobody is selling: with no market price to report, the craft cost is used
 * instead so a costable key is never left uncosted.
 *
 * On the `craft` basis `unitCost` is the craft cost even when the market is
 * cheaper, because the user has said they make their own keys and wants them
 * valued at what they actually pay. Two things that basis does **not** do:
 *
 * - It never part-prices a recipe. `describeDirectCraft` rejects a recipe
 *   outright when a material has no price, so `craftCost` is null rather than
 *   a total with a free material in it. A missing material is unknown, never
 *   zero, and it is never priced by recursing into how that material might
 *   itself be crafted either.
 * - It never leaves a costable key uncosted. When the recipe is missing or
 *   unpriceable the market quote is used instead and `cheaper` reports `'buy'`,
 *   so a display and a net worth both get the honest replacement cost rather
 *   than a null that every `?? 0` downstream would turn into a free key. Only
 *   when the market has nothing either is `unitCost` null.
 *
 * `cheaper` names the route actually used (`'buy'`/`'craft'`), not which side
 * happens to be less gold right now — those differ exactly when the market
 * basis is charging the market price while the recipe would have been
 * cheaper. Compare `craftCost` and `buyPrice` directly for the economic
 * comparison; `formatKeyCostNote` does this to phrase it without claiming the
 * figure charged is the cheaper one when it isn't.
 *
 * @param {string} keyHrid - Key item HRID
 * @param {Object} [options] - Costing options
 * @param {string} [options.mode] - Market side ('ask'/'bid'); defaults to the resolved setting
 * @param {string} [options.basis] - 'market' or 'craft'; defaults to the resolved setting, and

/**
 * The market-liquidity cap, at the display seam.
 *
 * `features/planner/market-liquidity.js` already measures the thing that
 * matters — how many units of an item actually change hands in a day — and the
 * goal planner bounds its gold rates with it. Every other profit surface kept
 * quoting the fiction: an alchemy ranking, an action-bar profit line or an
 * all-zones combat table would happily print 134.3B/hr for a method whose
 * output trades once a week. The price is real; the pace is not.
 *
 * This module is the one place those surfaces apply the same bound. It reuses
 * the planner's measurement (`sellThrottle`, `describeVelocity`) and its
 * wording — a capped figure carries `limited by market volume (~1/week)` and a
 * detail sentence naming the limiting item — so every surface says the same
 * thing about the same number.
 *
 * ## A display truth, not a calculator truth
 *
 * Nothing here mutates a calculator result another feature consumes. Callers
 * get a *copy* with the capped pace and a `liquidityLimit` marker on it; the
 * raw object keeps the raw claim. Net-worth, expected-value, the sim-vs-measured
 * calibration loop and the planner (which runs its own copy of this bound)
 * must keep reading uncapped figures, and they do, because they never come
 * through here.
 *
 * ## Unknowns, the planner's way
 *
 * An item the pooled history could not measure at all — the setting is off, the
 * server did not answer — bounds nothing: `absorbablePerHour` answers Infinity
 * for it, and crushing every rate because a third-party server is down would be
 * conservative in the way that unplugging the computer is. An item the history
 * *watched and saw nothing trade* is a measured zero and bounds all the way
 * down. Both behaviours are `market-liquidity.js`'s own, taken as-is.
 *
 * ## One switch for the whole display
 *
 * {@link LIQUIDITY_CAP_SETTING} (default on) turns the capping off display-wide
 * for a user who wants raw rates. It sits with the pricing settings, because it
 * is a statement about what a displayed rate means.
 *
 * ## Which copy of the measurement answers
 *
 * Same trick as `action-context.js` with the loadout store: in the production
 * multi-bundle build every bundle that imports this file would get its own copy
 * of `market-liquidity.js` and therefore its own volume cache, so at call time
 * the initialized shared copy on `window.Toolasha.Actions.marketLiquidity` is
 * preferred and the bundled import is the dev-build (single bundle) fallback.

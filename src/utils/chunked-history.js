/**
 * Append-only history, stored as records rather than as one array.
 *
 * ## The write amplification this exists to end
 *
 * A recorder that keeps its history in a single key does the same three things
 * on every event: read the whole array, push one entry, write the whole array
 * back. The cost of recording one loot drop is therefore the size of every loot
 * drop already recorded, and it grows for as long as the player keeps playing —
 * which is the shape of every quota failure this script has had. The loot log
 * rewrote five hundred entries per `loot_log_updated`; the alchemy trackers
 * rewrote every session ever, immediately, on every completed action.
 *
 * Splitting the array over several keys makes the write proportional to what
 * changed instead of to what is kept. A new entry lands in one record; the other
 * records are untouched, so IndexedDB never sees them.
 *
 * ## Chunks, not one key per entry
 *
 * A key per entry would make every write minimal, and would also put a thousand
 * keys per character into a store whose soft budget is measured in hundreds (see
 * `STORE_KEY_BUDGETS` in `core/storage.js`). Grouping entries by the hour, day or
 * month they belong to keeps both numbers small: the record written is the
 * current bucket, which holds the handful of entries recorded since the bucket
 * opened, and the key count grows with calendar time rather than with events.
 *
 * ## What the callers keep
 *
 * Nothing above this changes shape. A recorder still holds its history as one
 * array, still hands the whole array to `save()`, and still gets the whole array
 * back from `load()`. The diff against the last known state is what turns a
 * whole-array save into a one-record write, so the call sites did not have to
 * learn about chunking to stop paying for it.
 *
 * ## Migration, and what happens when the disk is full
 *
 * The legacy single-array key is split on the first read and then deleted. If
 * the split cannot be written — which on a full disk is exactly when it matters —
 * the legacy key is left alone and the recorder keeps using it. A migration that
 * bricked the history the moment storage filled up would be worse than the write
 * amplification it was meant to fix.

     * disk for that chunk went with it: a save another tab of this character
     * committed, or the entries a sync pull had just merged in from another
     * device — the pull folds, then the next append here wrote them away. The

     * `fold`), after the debounce, against what is stored at that moment, so
     * it sees every commit before it and nothing can land in between.
     *
     * The rule, per entry on disk:
     *
     * - one memory also holds keeps memory's copy, folded with the stored one
     *   by `mergeCopies` when the store has a rule — the same fold a pull makes,

     * - one a tombstone matches stays gone;
     * - anything else is news and is kept, on disk and — once the write has
     *   committed, and while the store still holds the same character — in
     *   memory, so the next save carries it too.
     *
     * **An adopted entry is never added to `_known` here.** The fold can run
     * more than once for one write — a transaction that aborts is requeued
     * with the same value and the same fold — and an id the first run had
     * marked as held would read, on the rerun, as one this store let go of,
     * and be written out of the disk copy. It joins `_known` only when a
     * bucket holding it is written (`_noteKnown`), which is when its absence
     * from a later bucket really is a removal.
     *
     * An empty bucket is the chunk's removal: what is left on disk after the
     * same rule is written, and the key is deleted only when nothing is.
     *
     * Debounced exactly as before, so the write count does not change: a chunk

     * Merge, never replace. The old shape of this wrote the legacy array's
     * chunks and then deleted every *other* record key belonging to the
     * character, on the reasoning that anything else was debris from an
     * interrupted earlier attempt. That reasoning stopped holding the moment a
     * legacy key could arrive from somewhere other than this device's own past:
     * a sync pull from a device whose split had stalled writes one, it lands
     * beside a full set of this device's records, and the next `load()` saw a
     * non-empty legacy key and deleted a year of local history to make room for
     * the five hundred entries the other device had.
     *
     * So the records are read first and the legacy entries are folded into
     * them, and no key that still carries entries is deleted — only the legacy
     * key itself. This is the shape `trade-ledger-store.js#_absorbLegacy`
     * already used for exactly the same situation.

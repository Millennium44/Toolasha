/**
 * Append-only history, stored as records rather than as one array.
 *
 * ## The write amplification this exists to end
 *
 * A recorder that keeps its history in a single key does the same three things
 * on every event: read the whole array, push one entry, write the whole array
 * back. The cost of recording one loot drop is therefore the size of every loot
 * drop already recorded, and it grows for as long as the player keeps playing —
 * which is the shape of every quota failure this script has had. The loot log
 * rewrote five hundred entries per `loot_log_updated`; the alchemy trackers
 * rewrote every session ever, immediately, on every completed action.
 *
 * Splitting the array over several keys makes the write proportional to what
 * changed instead of to what is kept. A new entry lands in one record; the other
 * records are untouched, so IndexedDB never sees them.
 *
 * ## Chunks, not one key per entry
 *
 * A key per entry would make every write minimal, and would also put a thousand
 * keys per character into a store whose soft budget is measured in hundreds (see
 * `STORE_KEY_BUDGETS` in `core/storage.js`). Grouping entries by the hour, day or
 * month they belong to keeps both numbers small: the record written is the
 * current bucket, which holds the handful of entries recorded since the bucket
 * opened, and the key count grows with calendar time rather than with events.
 *
 * ## What the callers keep
 *
 * Nothing above this changes shape. A recorder still holds its history as one
 * array, still hands the whole array to `save()`, and still gets the whole array
 * back from `load()`. The diff against the last known state is what turns a
 * whole-array save into a one-record write, so the call sites did not have to
 * learn about chunking to stop paying for it.
 *
 * ## Migration, and what happens when the disk is full
 *
 * The legacy single-array key is split on the first read and then deleted. If
 * the split cannot be written — which on a full disk is exactly when it matters —
 * the legacy key is left alone and the recorder keeps using it. A migration that
 * bricked the history the moment storage filled up would be worse than the write
 * amplification it was meant to fix.

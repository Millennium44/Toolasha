/**
 * Records a Reset can empty, kept so the Reset survives a sync pull.
 *
 * A record that only ever gains entries folds by union, and a union cannot
 * express "the user threw this away". Emptying such a record locally is
 * therefore undone the moment anything merges: `sync-payload.js` hands the
 * fold the local copy and the remote one, only the pulling device merges, and
 * the peer's still-full copy wins — so an emptied record comes straight back,
 * and comes back to the device that emptied it on the next pull.
 *
 * Per-entry tombstones are the wrong shape for a button that clears the whole
 * record: there is nothing to name. What a whole-record clear has instead is a
 * moment. A single `clearedAt` epoch stored beside the entries, unioned as a
 * max, is enough for the fold to drop every entry recorded before it — and,
 * because it is compared against each entry's own timestamp, it leaves alone
 * the entries the other device recorded *after* the clear. That ordering
 * hazard is the reason the epoch is the right shape and a boolean is not.
 *
 * The stored shape is `{ clearedAt, entries }`. A bare array is what every one
 * of these records held before, and reads as an uncleared record.
 */

/**
 * How many entries one fold may drop on a clear the local side does not hold.
 *
 * The mass-delete refusal from `custom-tabs-data.js`, in epoch form: a fold
 * must never be the thing that empties a record the user did not just clear.
 * The clear arrives from a store or a peer that may be wrong about it, and a
 * hundred-odd sessions of history disappearing during a pull is worse than a
 * Reset that has to be pressed again on this device — the clear still stands
 * where it was pressed, because that side holds the epoch and is exempt.
 *
 * A hundred is above the whole capacity of the small ring-capped records this
 * wraps (the replay check keeps 24 observations and 8 checks), so for those the
 * refusal cannot fire and the clear always lands: those records are a handful
 * of rows about recent runs, and losing them to a button pressed on another
 * device is the outcome the user asked for. It is below the labyrinth fight
 * pool's cap of a thousand, which is the record worth protecting — it is
 * passively accumulated over many runs and cannot be rebuilt on demand.

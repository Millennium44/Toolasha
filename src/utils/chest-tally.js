/**
 * Chest Tally
 *
 * What you actually got out of the chests you opened, against what they owed you.
 *
 * Toolasha already prices a chest before you open it — `expected-value-calculator.js`
 * says what one is worth on average, and that shows up in tooltips and net worth.
 * What it cannot say is whether the four hundred you have already opened paid out.
 * Expected value is a statement about the long run; this is the ledger that says
 * whether the long run has arrived.
 *
 * The comparison is deliberately made against **your own openings**, item by item,
 * rather than against a headline average. A chest that owes you one rare in two
 * hundred is not meaningfully behind after fifty, and the per-item breakdown is
 * what shows that the shortfall is one unlucky rare rather than something wrong
 * across the board.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the panel that draws it, for the usual reason: an
 * expectation computed slightly wrong still renders as a confident percentage.
 *
 * The idea and the ledger shape come from TReasure in MWI Combat Suite by Frotty
 * (MIT) — see `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`.

 * Purge rows that should never have been in the ledger, once.
 *
 * A build before this one recorded a scroll (`seal_of_*`) as though it were a
 * chest: it arrives on the same `loot_opened` message a chest does, so it got
 * its own bucket keyed by its own hrid. The display side filters those rows
 * out (`withoutScrolls` in `treasure-tracker.js`), but filtering is not
 * deleting — the bucket is still in storage, and a save folds the stored
 * ledger back under memory (`mergeStoredTally`), so simply deleting the key
 * in memory would only have it reappear on the next save, brought back by
 * storage's own copy or by a peer tab's.
 *
 * This is why the purge goes through `resetTally` rather than a plain delete:
 * a reset stamps the emptied bucket with `since`, and `mergeStoredTally` lets
 * the newer stamp win *whole* rather than maxing it against an older,
 * unstamped copy — the same mechanism a manual "Reset this chest" already
 * relies on to stick. A plain delete leaves no stamp, so the very next merge
 * against a stored or peer copy that still has the row restores it — see
 * `mergeStoredTally`'s doc for the contract this leans on.
 *
 * Callers should run this once per character behind a persisted flag (see
 * `settings-storage.js`'s `DEFAULT_REWRITES` for the shape) so a character
 * with no scroll rows costs nothing on every subsequent load, and so a scroll
 * row a player re-creates by opening more of the same item some other way is
 * never fought.

 * when this tab has been opening chests, storage's when a read that could not
 * be made left memory behind, or another tab got there first. `last` is memory's
 * wherever memory has the chest, since it is the opening this tab just saw.
 * Anything that is not a number is memory's.
 *
 * A reset is the exception, and the reason for `since`. Max-per-counter cannot
 * express "this went back to nought" — it undoes a reset unconditionally — so a
 * reset stamps the bucket it empties (`resetTally`) and a bucket whose stamp is
 * newer wins **whole**, counts and all, rather than being maxed against the
 * other side. An unstamped bucket therefore loses to a stamped one, which is
 * the right bias for an action confirmed through a danger dialog.
 *
 * That is also what keeps the peer's later openings: a device that has taken
 * the reset carries its stamp, and every opening it records afterwards goes
 * into that same stamped bucket (`recordOpening` carries `since` forward). Two
 * buckets counting since the same reset have equal stamps and fold by max as
 * they always did, so news from after the reset is never mistaken for news from
 * before it.
 *
 * `stored` is this device's copy in both callers — the save fold reads it back

/**
 * The standing guard over sub-modules a feature starts and never stops.
 *
 * A registered feature's `initialize()` starts something that is not itself a
 * registered feature, and the feature's teardown does not stop it. Both ends
 * look correct in isolation — the sub-module has a working `disable()`, the
 * parent has a working `cleanup()` — and nothing connects them. Three sites
 * accumulated a listener per character switch (`d86ec6125`, four leaked
 * `dataManager` listeners per `initializeFeatures()`, stable over twelve
 * cycles); two more served the departed character's data (`95d15e357`); a
 * sixth, `guild-trials.js` → `guildMemberSkills`, kept recording into a stale
 * guild's bucket after the feature was switched off. All six were found by
 * hand, by enumerating sixty-four parent→sub-module pairs and reading each.
 *
 * A seventh — `guild-trials.js` → `guildTrialAlerts`, still raising "the guild
 * trial has begun" for a feature the player had switched off — was found by
 * this scan, on its first tree-wide run, and is the reason to keep it.
 *
 * `init-ownership-coverage.test.js` cannot see this class and never could. It
 * looks for an `initialize()` that registers *after an await* without an
 * ownership ticket — a suspend race. `house-cost-display.js`'s `initialize()`
 * was perfectly well behaved; the defect was that nothing ever called its
 * `disable()`. No amount of await-scanning finds that, so this is a separate
 * scan in the same idiom: regex over source text, because `package.json` has no
 * parser and adding one to answer a question this shape can answer is not worth
 * the dependency.
 *
 * ## What it enumerates
 *
 * Every call of the shape `<module>.initialize(…)` / `.init(…)` / `.start(…)`
 * made from a file under `src/features`, where `<module>` is a *cross-file*
 * binding: an identifier imported from a relative path, or a module-level
 * `const` built by an imported factory (`const autofill =
 * createAutofillManager(…)`). Cross-file is the definition of a sub-module, and
 * it is also what keeps the scan honest — a module-level `const guildTrials =
 * new GuildTrials()` called from that same file's own `export default` is the
 * module starting *itself*, and admitting those added forty-four pairs and
 * eight flags with nothing behind any of them.
 *
 * ## What it asserts, per pair
 *
 * That the parent's teardown contains a matching teardown call on the same
 * binding — `.cleanup()`, `.disable()`, `.close()`, `.stop()` and the rest of
 * {@link TEARDOWN_CALL}. "The parent's teardown" is every function or method in
 * the file whose name starts with `disable`, `cleanup`, `teardown`, `destroy`
 * or `dispose`, because that is what the registry ends up calling:
 * `feature-registry.js:400` calls `disable()`, `entrypoint.js:2322-2327` maps a
 * module's `cleanup` onto `disable`, and `panel-observer.js` names its own
 * `disablePanelObserver()`.
 *
 * A pair that has no such call must earn an entry in {@link KNOWN_SAFE} with a
 * one-sentence reason. **The sentence is the whole point.** A bare list of
 * paths gets padded silently; a list where every entry has to say *what makes
 * this one safe* does not, because writing the sentence is the investigation
 * and a wrong sentence can be checked. Deliberately there is no second map for
 * known-but-unfixed sites: this test has two states, clean or actionable, and a
 * standing debt list is a suppression mechanism that accumulates.
 *
 * ## What it cannot do — read this before trusting a pass
 *
 * - It matches on the *binding name*, not on identity. A teardown that stops
 *   the sub-module through a different reference, or through a helper it calls,
 *   reads as missing; a parent whose teardown happens to name the binding in an
 *   unrelated call reads as paired.
 * - `forget()` and `reset()` are deliberately **not** teardown calls. They are
 *   the character-switch clear, which is a different obligation — the
 *   `guildMemberSkills` bug was precisely a `forget()` on the switch path
 *   standing in for a `cleanup()` that never came.
 * - Teardown bodies are pooled per file rather than tracked per method, so a
 *   sub-module stopped from a *different* teardown than the one the registry
 *   calls still reads as paired.
 * - `.start(steps)` is a job, not a lifecycle, and the scan cannot tell the two
 *   apart. Three such pairs sit in `KNOWN_SAFE` saying so.
 * - It says nothing about *ordering* — a teardown that stops a sub-module after
 *   something else has already torn out what it needs passes here.
 *
 * A pass therefore means "every cross-file start has a matching stop, or a
 * reason", not "no leaks".

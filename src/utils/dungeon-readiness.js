/**
 * Dungeon party readiness
 *
 * What can honestly be checked *before* the party enters, and — just as
 * importantly — what cannot.
 *
 * ## The shape of the problem
 *
 * A dungeon run is the one combat activity where stopping halfway is expensive:
 * the entry key is already spent, and the member who ran out of food takes the
 * whole party's clear down with them. So the useful moment to check is the
 * lobby, before the key is committed. The trouble is that the lobby is also the
 * moment the client knows least.
 *
 * The pre-run payload (`characterData.partyInfo`) carries member IDs, names,
 * the selected dungeon and its tier. It carries **no** equipment, **no**
 * consumables and **no** levels for anybody. Everything richer arrives with
 * `new_battle`, which is to say after the key is spent. A cached profile — one
 * the player happened to open in game at some point — can fill in a member's
 * gear, abilities and skills, and nothing can fill in their food.
 *
 * The one exception is entry keys. The game broadcasts a key-count message to
 * party chat naming every member and the keys they have left; the dungeon
 * tracker parses it and holds it for the run. That is server-stated, not
 * inferred, so a member's key line is as exact as the player's own — and it is
 * the only member figure that exists without a captured profile. Food and
 * drinks stay unknowable, and a member with keys read and food unread is
 * **not** a member who has been read.
 *
 * ## So this module reports three states, never two
 *
 * Every line is `known`, `unknown` or absent, and `unknown` carries the reason.
 * The alternative — quietly treating an unknown as fine — is the failure mode
 * that makes a readiness check worse than no readiness check: a green card that
 * means "I could not see four of the five people" reads exactly like a green
 * card that means "everyone is stocked".
 *
 * Pure throughout. Party rosters, inventories, profiles and run history all
 * arrive as arguments; nothing here imports game state.

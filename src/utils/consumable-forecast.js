/**
 * Consumable Forecast
 *
 * When the food and drinks run out, and what it costs to keep them topped up.
 *
 * This is the figure that decides whether a run survives the night. Everything
 * else on the overlay tells you how well the run is going; this tells you how
 * long it will still be going, which is the only one you can act on before it is
 * too late to act on it.
 *
 * ## The one that matters is the soonest
 *
 * A character stops when its **first** consumable runs out, not its average one.
 * So the headline is a minimum, not a mean, and a consumable that is not being
 * used at all has to be kept out of that minimum rather than counted as lasting
 * forever and quietly winning it.
 *
 * Kept pure and apart from the panel because the arithmetic has several answers
 * that look right: a rate of zero that means "not used" against one that means
 * "not measured yet", a stock of zero that means "ran out" against one that
 * means "never had any", and a refill figure that has to be rounded up, since
 * nine and a half drinks is ten drinks.

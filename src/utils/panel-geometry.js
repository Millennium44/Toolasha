/**
 * Panel Geometry
 *
 * Where a floating panel was left, and how big it was left.
 *
 * Every panel in this script had its own answer to this, which is to say most of
 * them had none: they opened at a hardcoded corner at a hardcoded width, and a
 * panel you have to drag and resize on every page load is a panel you stop
 * opening. One store, keyed by panel, so a new panel gets the behaviour by
 * calling one function.
 *
 * The clamping is the part worth having apart from the DOM. A panel remembers
 * the window it was left in, and that window may since have been narrower — a
 * saved position restored blindly puts the panel somewhere you cannot reach it,
 * which looks exactly like a feature that stopped working.
 *
 * Geometry is deliberately shared by every character on the account: a panel
 * should sit where you put it whichever character you logged in as. Whether a
 * panel was *open* is not — the market character's eight open panels reopening
 * on top of the iron cow is the one part of this that is per-character, and it
 * lives in its own key, `panelOpenState_<characterId>`.

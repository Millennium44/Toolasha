/**
 * Recovering monster names after a reload
 *
 * A `battle_updated` tick carries `cHP`, `cMP` and two counters per monster, and
 * nothing that says what the monster is. Identity arrives once, in `new_battle`,
 * and a page reloaded mid-fight never sees that message — so everything that hits
 * you for the rest of that battle is filed under "Unknown Enemy", and so is
 * everything you kill in it. MCS has the same hole for the same reason.
 *
 * The names do exist, though: the game is drawing them on screen. Each monster in
 * the battle panel is a tile with its name and its health bar, and the health bar
 * is the useful part — it is the same number the tick reports as `cHP`.
 *
 * ## Matched by health, not by position
 *
 * The obvious join is positional: the first tile is monster 0. That is an
 * assumption about how the panel handles a dead monster, which is exactly the
 * kind of assumption that is right until a game update and then silently
 * mis-attributes everything. Health is a fact both sides state, so it is what
 * the two are matched on.
 *
 * Two monsters at the same health are ambiguous, and the ambiguity resolves
 * itself: if the candidates all have the same name it does not matter which one
 * it is, and if they do not, nothing is claimed. A wave of three Eyes at full
 * health is the common case and it is the harmless one.
 *
 * ## It fails closed
 *
 * Every part of this reads the game's DOM, which is not a contract. A missing
 * panel, a renamed class, a tile whose text no longer starts with the name — each
 * of them produces nothing, and nothing means the tracker carries on saying
 * "Unknown Enemy" exactly as it does today. Nothing here can produce a wrong
 * name where there was previously a right one.

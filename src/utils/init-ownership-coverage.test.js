/**
 * The standing guard over the character-switch race in feature `initialize()`.
 *
 * Twenty-six sites have been fixed by hand across five commits. Every one of
 * them was the same shape: an `initialize()` that suspends on a storage read,
 * a `character_switching` teardown that lands inside the read, and a resumed
 * tail that registers listeners, observers or timers into fields the teardown
 * has just nulled — one live, unremovable registration per switch, for as long
 * as the tab lives. `utils/init-ownership.js` is the fix; three hand surveys
 * are how the sites were found. Nothing found by a hand survey stops site #27
 * being written next week, which is what this file is for.
 *
 * It is a source-text scan, in the idiom of the `notForwarded` block in
 * `src/entrypoint.test.js`: there is no parser in `package.json` and adding one
 * to answer a question this shape can answer is not worth the dependency.
 *
 * ## What it does
 *
 * Extracts the body of every `async initialize/init/start/register` under
 * `src/features` by brace matching, and flags one where a registration-shaped
 * call appears textually **after the first `await`** with no ownership marker
 * anywhere in the body. A flagged body must either grow a marker or earn an
 * entry in `KNOWN_SAFE` below.
 *
 * ## What it cannot do — read this before trusting a pass
 *
 * The scan is textual, not semantic. Specifically:
 *
 * - It cannot see through a helper that registers on the module's behalf. A
 *   tail calling `this._wireEverything()` reads as clean unless the call itself
 *   happens to match a registration shape by name.
 * - It cannot follow a registration into a function called from the tail rather
 *   than written inline in it.
 * - It cannot tell a live registration from an idempotent one. Every entry in
 *   `KNOWN_SAFE` exists because a human read the downstream code and the scan
 *   could not.
 * - `stripNestedAsync` removes nested `async` callbacks before looking for the
 *   first `await`, so an `await` inside a `run: async () => {…}` handed to
 *   `registerCommand` is correctly not treated as a suspension point of the
 *   initializer. A non-async nested function cannot contain `await` at all. An
 *   `(async () => {…})()` IIFE is deliberately *not* stripped — that is the
 *   initializer's own work, not a callback.
 * - Comments and string literals are blanked first, so prose about awaits does
 *   not read as an await. Regex literals are not, so a `/` opening one could in
 *   principle confuse the string pass; nothing under `src/features` does today.
 * - Only entry points declared `async` are candidates. A synchronous
 *   `initialize()` cannot suspend, whatever its callbacks await.
 *
 * A pass therefore means "nothing matching the shape we know how to see", not
 * "no races". The per-site `*.switch-race.test.js` files are what prove a
 * specific fix; this proves nobody added a new site of the known shape.
 *
 * ## Why the self-test at the bottom exists
 *
 * A refactor that silently breaks one of these regexes leaves a test that
 * passes forever and detects nothing — the exact failure mode the whole
 * exercise is about. So the matcher is driven against inline fixtures with
 * known-bad and known-good shapes, and against the real pre-fix source of an
 * already-fixed site pulled out of git.

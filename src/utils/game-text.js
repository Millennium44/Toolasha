/**
 * Game-Text Constants
 *
 * Every load-bearing English literal the script matches against text the game
 * renders, in one place. These strings are as much a part of the game's API as
 * its class names and data keys: a rewording ("Battle started:" becoming
 * "Battle begins:") silently blinds every consumer, with no error anywhere.
 * Collecting them here makes the dependency visible, greppable, and testable —
 * game-text.test.js pins each one against a real message it was seen in.
 *
 * String constants are for consumers that `includes()`/`split()`; the RegExp
 * constants preserve exactly the pattern their consumer matched with before the
 * literal moved here (word boundaries, optional spacing, case-insensitivity).
 * None carry the `g` flag, so sharing one instance across modules is safe.

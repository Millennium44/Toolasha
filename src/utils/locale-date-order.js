/**
 * Which of month and day the runtime's locale prints first, and the date a chat
 * stamp means.
 *
 * Chat stamps carry two bare numbers ("[02/03 …]"), no clue which is which and
 * no year. Guessing the order from the digits alone only ever works for days
 * 13-31; on a dd/mm client every day of 12 or less reads as a month, which is
 * twelve days in every month misread. The runtime locale is the missing clue:
 * the game renders the stamp through the same locale this reports on.
 *
 * The runtime locale, specifically, and not the game's own language setting:
 * the client builds the stamp with `toLocaleDateString(undefined, …)`, and its
 * bundle passes a locale to no date formatter at all. Only its *numbers* follow
 * the game's language (see `number-parser.js`); its dates follow the browser.
 * Changing the game's language leaves the stamp format alone — confirmed both in
 * the client bundle and by changing it in the game's own settings.

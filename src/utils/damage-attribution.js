/**
 * Damage attribution
 *
 * Who hit what, derived from a payload that never says.
 *
 * `battle_updated` carries every unit's current state and no events. Working out
 * that "Bob crit the rat for 4,120" from two of those snapshots is the whole
 * problem, and there is no attribution field to read — the trick is elsewhere.
 *
 * ## An attack counter identifies the attacker
 *
 * Each player carries `atkCounter`, and it goes up when they attack. On a
 * five-player recording it decided 89% of all damage exactly — the join
 * between a player and a monster's lost health, and the one signal that also
 * expresses misses, crits and the per-ability split.
 *
 * ## Presence is the attribution when no counter moved
 *
 * The server groups each `battle_updated` by **actor**: the player in a tick's
 * `pMap` is the one whose action the tick reports — their swing's damage,
 * their damage-over-time effect ticking, their thorns firing. So when nobody's
 * counter rose and exactly one player is in the tick, the damage is theirs.
 *
 * This module used to believe the opposite, and the correction is worth
 * keeping on record. On that five-player recording, 82 of 440 damage ticks
 * had the lone character present because their own health and damage counter
 * had moved — being *hit*, not attacking — and crediting them looked like
 * handing 8,500 points of other people's damage to whoever held aggro. So the
 * fallback became "the last character to swing". Adjudicating the same
 * recording against the counters showed the diagnosis was wrong: every one of
 * those ticks also carried the **monster's own attack counter rising** — the
 * monster attacked, the tank was hit, and the health the monster lost in the
 * same breath was the tank's **thorns**. The last-swinger fallback was not
 * protecting the tank's teammates; it was stealing the tank's reflect, 5.7%
 * of the party's damage, tick by provable tick. The remaining lone-present
 * ticks were players present with *nothing* changed about them while the
 * monster took a counted hit — their DoT ticking, which is itself the
 * actor-grouping stated as plainly as a payload can state it.
 *
 * Mana sits below both: only an ability costs mana, so a **unique** `cMP` drop
 * still separates the caster out of a *small* party. Unique, not
 * last-of-several — with synchronized builds two casts land on the same tick,
 * and "whoever iterated last wins" is an iteration-order artifact, not an
 * attribution. And only up to {@link COLLISION_SPLIT_THRESHOLD} present
 * players: past that, "exactly one person spent mana" stops being evidence,
 * because most of a trial's roster auto-attacks and leaves no mana trace, so
 * the one caster on the tick would collect everybody's damage. The last swinger
 * remains as the final fallback for the multi-player tick nothing else can
 * split.
 *
 * ## Every payload arrives twice
 *
 * 757 of 1,465 `battle_updated` messages in that recording are byte-identical to
 * the one before. Nothing here has to care — a duplicate diffs to no change and
 * produces no events — but it is why the swing behind a hit looks two ticks back
 * rather than one.
 *
 * ## A counter distinguishes a hit from a tick
 *
 * Health falling is not sufficient — bleeds and regeneration move it too. A hit
 * is `dmgCounter` **rising**, and a crit is `critCounter` rising. Which also
 * gives the one case a health diff can never express: `dmgCounter` up with the
 * health unchanged is a **miss**, not a non-event.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not guess. A small tick where several players act at once falls back
 * to the lone mana drop, because the payload cannot separate them otherwise —
 * and a tick that names nobody at all credits nobody rather than the wrong body.
 *
 * ## Health that fell without a counter is still damage
 *
 * A hit is `dmgCounter` rising, and everything else used to be discarded. A
 * bleed tick and a thorns reflect move a monster's health without moving its
 * hit counter, so every point of it fell out of the per-player tables while
 * still showing up in the party total measured off the boss bar — the two
 * disagreed by exactly the damage-over-time volume. Those ticks are now their
 * own event class (`isDot`), attributed by the same rungs as a hit and folded
 * into a `dotDamage` subtotal that rides *inside* `damage`, so every total that
 * already existed is now right and the breakdown can still name the share.
 * Hit, miss and crit counts do not move for them: a bleed is not a swing.
 *
 * ## A collision too big to adjudicate is split, not awarded
 *
 * When several players act on one tick and nothing above can separate them, the
 * last rung used to hand the whole tick to whoever swung most recently. In a
 * five-person party that is a rounding error; in a thirty-person guild trial it
 * is a systematic bias towards one slot, and the slot is chosen by iteration
 * order rather than by anything that happened. Above
 * {@link COLLISION_SPLIT_THRESHOLD} players present, the tick's damage is split
 * equally between them instead — imperfect, but bounded: nobody who acted reads
 * zero, and nobody collects a crowd's work.
 *
 * Equal rather than weighted by damage already confirmed. KikiMeter tried the
 * weighted version on real trial captures and abandoned it: players who never
 * won a solo-confirmed tick stayed at zero while the early winners took the
 * whole ambiguous stream — rich-get-richer, 56% mean error against the game's
 * own end-of-trial figures.
 *
 * ## A slot's maximum health changing is a new monster in it
 *
 * `new_guild_battle` arrives once to three times in a whole hour, so a trial's
 * baselines have no periodic safety net the way a personal fight's do (a
 * `new_battle` every wave). A monster respawning into the same slot would read
 * as its predecessor healing, or worse as phantom damage. Any change to a
 * slot's `mHP` is therefore a new instance: re-baseline the slot and count
 * nothing across the transition.
 *
 * The model is DPs' and the Floating Combat Text tool's, from MWI Combat Suite
 * by Frotty (MIT) — see `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and
 * `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The un-countered-damage event class, the
 * bounded equal split and the max-health respawn guard are KikiMeter v3.32.1's
 * by ZhuLiMoon (MIT) — see `third-party/kikimeter/`. The code is Toolasha's own.

/**
 * Fold events into a per-monster tally.
 *
 * The player table answers "who is doing the damage". This answers "to what",
 * which is the other half of a fight: a run that looks slow is often one zone's
 * worth of a single tanky monster rather than a rotation problem, and no
 * per-ability figure can say so.
 *
 * Keyed by name rather than by index, because an index is one spawn — a zone
 * cycles through dozens of them and the question is about the kind of monster,
 * not this particular rat.
 *
 * @param {Object} tally - `{}` or a previous return, mutated
 * @param {Array<Object>} events - From `attributeTick`
 * @param {Function} nameOf - `(monsterIndex) => string|null`
 * @returns {Object} Monster name → `{damage, dotDamage, hits, crits, misses, kills, byAbility}`

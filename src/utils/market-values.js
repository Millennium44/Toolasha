/**
 * Official market values and the tradable-range clamp.
 *
 * Since the 8/13/2026 update the game publishes an estimated value for every
 * item and enhancement level — the same figure behind the inventory's "Total
 * Market Value" tooltip. Two things follow from it:
 *
 *  - A **value** for items whose live order book is empty or stale, so networth
 *    can price an illiquid item the way the game does rather than falling all
 *    the way back to crafting cost.
 *  - A **tradable range** (about ±10% around the value): the game rejects buy
 *    or sell orders outside it, so a hypothetical sell above the band or buy
 *    below it cannot actually fill. A stale snapshot price parked outside the
 *    band would otherwise print an impossible profit or valuation.
 *
 * The range is computed the way the game computes it: ±10% of the value,
 * snapped outward to the price-increment ladder and widened by one increment
 * on each side (the 8/14/2026 hotfix — cheap items get a proportionally wider
 * range). The ladder is the game client's own `getBinnedPrice` tiering, read
 * out of its bundle and verified against live band bounds across nine decades
 * of price on 8/18/2026 — see {@link priceIncrement}. One caveat survives:
 * bands *recalibrate toward* the value at ≤1% per hourly pass, so right after
 * a value moves, the game's actual band lags what this computes from the new
 * value until the passes catch up.
 *
 * The map is reached through the game's own `localStorageUtil.getMarketItemValues()`
 * (via dataManager), which decompresses the localStorage blob for us — reading it
 * raw yields compressed bytes. The dev's advice was to cache it rather than
 * re-fetch, so the util is called at most once per refresh interval and the map
 * is swapped only when its version changes; everything else reads the cache.
 * A pushed `market_item_values_updated` message swaps the cache directly —
 * see {@link applyMarketValuesMessage} — so a mid-session refresh does not wait
 * out the interval.
 *
 * All of this is gated behind {@link isMarketplacePatchLive}: the util does not
 * exist on the live server until the patch lands, so before then every helper
 * here is an inert pass-through and the plugin behaves exactly as it did.

 * swap in a cache that prices nothing; an array or string equally passes
 * `typeof === 'object'`/`'string'` naively but carries nothing keyed by item

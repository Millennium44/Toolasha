/**
 * The health checks, tested against faked anchors.
 *
 * They live on the registration entries rather than in a module, which is right
 * — a check is about how a feature is wired into the page, not about the
 * feature's own logic — but it means the only way to reach one is to boot the
 * entrypoint and take the registry it hands over. That is what this does: every
 * library is a stub, `replaceFeatures` is the seam, and the predicates come out
 * the other side as ordinary functions to run against a DOM built by hand.
 *
 * What is worth asserting is not that a present marker reads as healthy — it is
 * the two ways a health pass turns into noise. A panel that is not open must
 * read as "cannot tell", and a readout the player switched off must read as
 * healthy, because "N features failed to start" is a claim that stops being
 * believed the first time it is wrong.

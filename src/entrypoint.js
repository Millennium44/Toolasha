 * Health checks
 *
 * `featureRegistry.checkFeatureHealth()` has run since the beginning and has
 * always found nothing, because it skips any feature without a `healthCheck`
 * and no feature had one. The registry entry is the right place to put them:
 * a check belongs to how the feature is wired into the page, not to the module,
 * and writing them here keeps ~150 feature modules untouched.
 *
 * The contract the registry expects, from `checkFeatureHealth`:
 *
 *   true   — healthy
 *   false  — broken; the feature is retried once and then reported
 *   null   — cannot tell right now; ignored
 *
 * The registry has already skipped anything switched off (`customCheck`, or
 * `config.isFeatureEnabled(key)`) before calling these, so a check never has to
 * ask whether its own feature is on. It does have to ask about the sub-settings
 * that gate what gets drawn — `actionBar_enabled` under `actionTimeDisplay`,
 * for instance — because a feature whose output the player turned off is not a
 * feature that failed. Those cases return true.
 *
 * Every check is the same shape: *given the game has drawn the thing this
 * feature attaches to, did the feature's own mark appear on it?* No anchor
 * means the panel is not open, which is not evidence of anything — null. The
 * predicates, feature by feature:
 *
 *   networth              header total-level block exists  → .mwi-networth-header
 *   marketOrderTotals     header total-level block exists  → .mwi-market-order-totals
 *   actionTimeDisplay     header action-name block exists  → #mwi-action-time-display
 *   taskIcons             a task card is on screen         → [data-mwi-task-processed]
 *   taskStatistics        the Tasks tab strip exists       → .toolasha-task-stats-btn
 *   overlayTabButton      the tab strip holding Inventory  → #toolasha-overlay-tab
 *   skillExpPercentage    a nav XP bar with a width        → .mwi-exp-percentage
 *   skillRemainingXP      a nav XP bar with a label        → .mwi-remaining-xp
 *   inventoryBadgeManager inventory item containers        → [data-ask-value] on one
 *   inventoryBadgePrices  an item priced above zero        → .mwi-badge-price-ask/bid
 *   itemCountDisplay      marketplace item tiles           → .mwi-item-count
 *   zoneIndices           combat zone tab buttons          → span.script_mapIndex
 *   combatScore           a profile overview tab is open   → #mwi-combat-score-panel
 *
 * None of the above can catch the game renaming its own classes wholesale — an
 * absent anchor just reads as "null, ignored" everywhere above. `checkAnchorCanaries`
 * is the separate check for that: a handful of selectors for elements that exist
 * on any loaded game page no matter which panel is open (the header, the page's
 * own wrapper, the persistent skill nav bars). It runs once, on the same delay as
 * the health pass, and reports through the same `UI.healthStatus.reportFailures`
 * channel with reason "selector missing — game update?".
 *
 * `UI.schemaCanary` is the third of these, and the one that looks at neither the
 * page nor the features but at the game's own data: the top-level maps this
 * script indexes by literal key, the item and buff-type hrids it matches by
 * literal string, and the dungeon wave counts it falls back to. Those fail even
 * more quietly than a selector does — a renamed map is `{}`, a renamed hrid is
 * `null` — so it runs beside the selector canary and reports through the same
 * channel with reason "data shape changed — game update?".

 * the game renaming its classes out from under every selector at once. A
 * missing feature mark says "reopen the panel"; a missing anchor says the game
 * updated.
 *
 * Two kinds of entry:
 *
 * - **Ungated** (the first four): anchors that exist on any loaded page no
 *   matter which panel is open — the header, the page's own wrapper, the
 *   persistent skill nav bars. Their absence is always evidence.
 * - **Gated** (`when`): the highest-fanout hashed-class selectors in the
 *   codebase — `Item_itemContainer` alone is load-bearing in twenty-odd files
 *   — which only exist on particular screens. Each is checked only while its
 *   `when` selector matches: an element from the same screen that cannot be
 *   drawn without the canaried one. A closed panel therefore reads as "no
 *   evidence" rather than as a failure, which is what keeps this from being
 *   noise on every page where a panel is legitimately shut.
 *
 * Gates are taken from a *different* CSS-module component wherever one
 * co-exists (Inventory_↔Item_, Chat_→ChatMessage_, BattlePanel_→CombatUnit_,
 * [role="tablist"]→TabsComponent_), so a whole component renaming still trips
 * the canary whose gate survived. Where no cross-component witness exists
 * (SkillActionDetail, RandomTask) the pair gates on a sibling class: a rename
 * of one class in the component is caught, a rename of the whole component
 * falls back to the ungated four.
 *
 * The name half of the SkillActionDetail pair gates on the *regular* component
 * (`SkillActionDetail_regularComponent`) rather than the shared detail wrapper,
 * because the alchemy and enhancing panels reuse that wrapper but draw no name
 * heading — gating on the wrapper alarmed on every alchemy or enhancing screen.
 * Detection of a real `_name` rename survives: the regular panel still carries
 * the name, so a rename there trips it as before.
 *
 * Left out on purpose, despite their fanout: `Item_enhancementLevel` (only
 * drawn when an enhanced item happens to be on screen — no screen guarantees
 * one, so its absence is never evidence) and `ProgressBar_text` (absent
 * whenever the action queue is empty, and only one file leans on it).

/**
 * Treasure Tracker
 *
 * Keeps a ledger of every chest you open, and shows whether they paid out.
 *
 * Toolasha already prices a chest before you open it, in tooltips and in net
 * worth. That is a claim about the long run. This is the record of whether the
 * long run has turned up: how many you have opened, what came out, and what the
 * drop tables said should have.
 *
 * The tracking runs whenever the feature is on, whether or not the panel is
 * open — a ledger you have to remember to start is a ledger with nothing in it
 * when you finally want to read it. Only the drawing waits for the panel.
 *
 * The arithmetic is in `utils/chest-tally.js`. This module listens, stores, and
 * draws.
 *
 * The idea is TReasure's, from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The panel
 * is Toolasha's own.

 * Drop every tab in a subtree whose id was deleted after that copy was last

 *
 * Applied through the whole tree, not just the top level: `removeTab` takes a
 * subtree with it, so a nested id can be tombstoned while its root survives.
 *
 * An UNSTAMPED tab is never deleted by a tombstone. `stampOf` answers 0 for
 * every tab written before stamps existed (pre-3.22.0), and a tombstone's
 * `deletedAt` is a Date.now()-scale number, so the plain comparison made ANY
 * tombstone beat EVERY legacy tab — and this runs at LOAD, not only on sync, so
 * a stored `removed` map naming legacy tabs pruned them off disk on the next
 * page load. When the stamp is 0 the ordering is genuinely unknowable, and for
 * a list the user authored by hand the safe answer is to keep the tab and drop
 * the tombstone: reviving one deleted tab costs a second click, losing a
 * curated tree costs an evening.
 *
 * A REVIVED SUBTREE comes back whole. `removeTab` tombstones the root and every
 * descendant at the same instant, so when the root's tombstone turns out to be
 * stale news — the other device edited the subtree after the deletion — every
 * descendant tombstone from that same removal is stale news too. Comparing each
 * descendant against its own stamp instead resurrected the root carrying only
 * the children that happened to be edited and silently dropped the untouched
 * siblings, which is the one outcome worse than either "deleted" or "kept".
 * `revivedAt` carries the cleared ancestor's `deletedAt` down: a descendant
 * tombstone no newer than it belongs to the removal that was just undone, while
 * a NEWER one is an independent later deletion and still applies.

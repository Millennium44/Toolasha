/**
 * Equipment Savings
 *
 * The gear you are saving for, and when you will have it.
 *
 * Wanting a piece of equipment is a savings problem, and the game gives you no
 * help with it at all: the price is on one screen, your coins on another, and
 * what you earn per day nowhere. So the question people actually ask — "can I
 * afford the sword yet, and if not, when" — is answered by opening the market,
 * squinting, and subtracting in your head, several times a day, for weeks.
 *
 * ## What an upgrade costs is not what it is priced at
 *
 * You sell the piece it replaces. The cost is the target's ask **less** the bid
 * on what you are wearing, which for a late-game slot is most of the price —
 * reading the ask alone can double the figure. Somebody keeping the old piece
 * for a second loadout pays the full ask, so the trade-in is the **Keep old
 * gear** switch rather than an assumption baked into the number.
 *
 * ## The ladder
 *
 * A target nobody sells is a run at the anvil, and the cheapest run starts from
 * the best copy you own — which is the one you are wearing. That number is
 * honest and it is also a bet with your kit: a failure takes the equipped piece
 * down or away. So the card carries the ladder beside it: the same target
 * reached from your *second*-best copy, or from a base you buy or make when
 * there is no second copy, leaving what you fight in untouched.
 *
 * ## Levels are on the list too
 *
 * "Fierce Aura to 46" is a savings goal in every way a sword is: a pile of books
 * at what the market wants for them, against the coins you have. So ability
 * levels sit on the same list — added by hand from the panel, or handed over by
 * a sim run that has just costed one — and a goal you have read your way past
 * says so rather than sitting there at full price forever.
 *
 * A house room is the same again: "Mystical Study to 5" is the coins each level
 * asks for outright plus the materials it wants, at what the market would charge
 * to go and buy them. Rooms get their own set of cards beside the levels, and a
 * room you have since built says Reached rather than staying on the bill.
 *
 * ## Everything, not just each thing
 *
 * A slot at a time answers the wrong question when you want three pieces. The
 * Everything row is the whole list against your coins, because that is the plan
 * you are actually saving towards.
 *
 * The arithmetic is in `utils/equipment-savings.js` with tests. This module
 * reads the market, the character and the income, and draws.
 *
 * The model is EWatch's, from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

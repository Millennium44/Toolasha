/**
 * Watchlist
 *
 * A list of items you care about, what you hold, and what it is worth.
 *
 * Inventory Value already says what the whole bag is worth, which is a number
 * you cannot act on — it moves when anything moves. The question behind this one
 * is narrower and answerable: *these thirty things, how many have I got, what
 * are they worth, and which of them should I not be selling on the market.*
 *
 * ## Building the list is the feature
 *
 * Adding thirty items one at a time is thirty clicks and a wiki tab, and nobody
 * does it twice. So a whole zone's drop table goes on with one tick, read from
 * the game's own data — both drop tables of every ordinary spawn and every boss,
 * or the reward table if it is a dungeon. Chests work the same way. Items can
 * still be added one at a time, and those are never removed by un-ticking
 * anything.
 *
 * ## The vendor warning
 *
 * A market bid below what the vendor pays flat is not a price, it is a trap, and
 * a list that reports it as the item's value quietly advises the worse of two
 * sales. Those rows show the vendor price and say so. Toolasha already made this
 * comparison inside the bulk-sell flow; here it stands as a property of the item
 * rather than as a step in selling one.
 *
 * The set algebra is in `utils/watchlist.js` and the drop-table walking in
 * `utils/drop-sources.js`, both with tests. This module reads the game, draws
 * the panel, and does no arithmetic of its own.
 *
 * The panel is NTally's, from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

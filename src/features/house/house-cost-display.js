/**
 * The one game element this file restyles, and why it has to.
 *
 * `HousePanel_modalContent` is a flex column, so everything in it — the game's
 * own costs, the game's **Build** button, and the section this file appends —
 * is a flex item, and a flex line that asks for more height than the panel has
 * takes the difference back out of its items.
 *
 * That is a fight nobody wins. Whichever item is willing to shrink is the one
 * that gets ruined:
 *
 * - Leave our section shrinkable (`min-height: 0`, added in f094f9adc to stop
 *   the Build button collapsing) and the section is squeezed below its own
 *   contents — measured at 155px around a 352px materials list — so the list,
 *   the total and the marketplace button all render *outside* the section's
 *   rounded border. And the Build button still ends up 11px tall, because
 *   shrinkage is shared out in proportion, not handed to one volunteer.
 * - Make our section refuse to shrink (`flex-shrink: 0`) and the whole deficit
 *   lands on the Build button, whose `overflow: hidden` resolves its automatic
 *   minimum size to zero. It collapses to 0px. That is f094f9adc's bug, back.
 *
 * There is no split of a fixed height that is not somebody's bug, so the fix is
 * to stop the height being fixed. `min-height` beats both `height` and
 * `max-height` at used-value time, so `fit-content` makes the panel grow to
 * hold its items however it was being clamped — a shrunken flex item, a
 * percentage height, a max-height. Nothing has to give, and in Chromium and
 * WebKit the modal's own scroller (`Modal_modalContent`, which is what the
 * game provides for content that runs long) sees the true height and can
 * reach the bottom of it.
 *
 * Firefox is the exception, and it needs a rule of its own — see
 * `SCROLLER_MAX_HEIGHT` below.
 *
 * `:has(.mwi-house-to-level)` is the restore path. The rule only ever matches a
 * house panel that is currently carrying this file's section, so removing the
 * section — a room switch, `removeExistingColumn()`, a game update that renames
 * the class — leaves the panel exactly as the game styles it, with no undo to
 * remember. `disable()` takes the stylesheet out as well.
 *
 * A browser that does not understand `:has()` drops the whole rule, and then
 * `flex-shrink: 0` is left in force with nothing absorbing the deficit — which
 * is exactly the second bullet above, the Build button at 0px. A layout
 * refinement that fails to apply is acceptable; a missing Build button is not,
 * so `applyPanelMinHeightFallback()` sets the same `min-height` inline on those
 * browsers. See `PANEL_MIN_HEIGHT` and `supportsHasSelector()`.
 */
const PANEL_MIN_HEIGHT = 'fit-content';

/**
 * The values the inline fallback will try for `min-height`, in order.
 *
 * The stylesheet only ever needs the first: a browser new enough to understand
 * `:has()` understands unprefixed `fit-content` too. The fallback runs on
 * exactly the browsers that are not, and the band it covers reaches back past
 * unprefixed sizing keywords (Safari before 15.4, Firefox before 94), so it
 * tries the prefixed spellings when the plain one does not take. A value the
 * browser cannot parse leaves `style.minHeight` empty, which is the test.

/**
 * The cap this file puts on the game's own scroller (`Modal_modalContent`),
 * Firefox-only in effect but harmless everywhere else.
 *
 * `Modal_modal` (the frame) is `display: grid; grid-template-rows: 100%;
 * max-height: 96%`, no `height`. Chromium and WebKit re-resolve that `100%`
 * row against the max-height-clamped frame, so `Modal_modalContent` — the
 * game's scroller, `overflow: auto` — is stuck inside it. Firefox does not:
 * it sizes the row to the scroller's content instead, so once `fit-content`
 * above lets the panel grow past the frame, the scroller grows with it and
 * hangs 267–338px past the frame at phone widths (314px at 1280×700) — still
 * scrollable, but its bottom, and the Missing Mats button on it, is off
 * screen. Undoing `fit-content` does not help (measured): the deficit just
 * goes back to squeezing the section or the Build button, see above.
 *
 * So the frame's own limit is restated directly on the scroller instead of
 * trusted to flow down through the grid row: 96% mirrors `Modal_modal`'s own
 * `max-height`, and `- 2px` is the frame's 1px top + bottom border. `box-sizing:
 * border-box` puts the scroller's own padding (`Modal_modalContent`'s
 * `padding: var(--spacing-sm)`) inside that cap rather than added on top of
 * it — without it Firefox still overshoots, by the padding (measured 11px).
 * The unit is the visible viewport, same as
 * `--toolasha-visual-viewport-height`'s other use in
 * `action-panel-layout.js`: it tracks the address bar and the on-screen
 * keyboard, which `vh` does not.
 *
 * It is a `max-height`, so a short panel — most of them — never reaches it and
 * renders exactly as before. Measured with this rule: Firefox now keeps the
 * scroller inside the frame and the Missing Mats button on screen at
 * 375×812, 375×640 and 1280×700; Chromium and WebKit are unchanged apart from
 * the frame being 2px shorter, which nothing else here measures against.
 *
 * `:has(.mwi-house-to-level)` self-scopes the same way `PANEL_MIN_HEIGHT`'s
 * rule does, and for the same reason a browser without `:has()` needs a
 * fallback: `applyScrollerMaxHeightFallback()` sets this inline on exactly
 * those browsers (Firefox before 121 is exactly the population this rule
 * exists for), and `clearScrollerMaxHeightFallback()` is its undo.

 * scrolling ancestor, not the border edge — so anything below it inside that
 * scroller (here, the scroller's own bottom padding) makes the footer travel
 * those last pixels at the very end of the scroll, and the three engines
 * disagree about how much (measured 2.5px Firefox / 9.6px Chrome / 2.6px
 * WebKit) because they account for that padding differently. There is no
 * single offset that fixes all three, so the padding is removed instead: with
 * nothing below the footer, pinned and resting coincide (measured sub-pixel in

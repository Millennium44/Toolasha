/**
 * House affordability
 *
 * How many house upgrades your coins currently cover, and what the cheapest one
 * is.
 *
 * The costing is `utils/house-cost-calculator.js` — this only asks it a
 * different question. That calculator returns the **cumulative** cost of taking
 * a room from nothing to a level, so the price of the next upgrade alone is the
 * difference between two of its answers rather than anything new.
 *
 * The figure is worth having because the alternative is opening each room in
 * turn to see what it wants, and the answer changes with the market rather than
 * only when you spend.

/**
 * Guided crafting walk.
 *
 * The crafting plan already says what to make and in what order; what it cannot
 * do from a list is put you in front of each step. This walks the plan: it opens
 * the game on one step's action, types that step's count into the game's own
 * count box, and then stops. Adapted from MWITools semiAutoTrain,
 * CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, see third-party/mwitools/.
 *
 * **One user click is one game action, always.** The walk never presses a game
 * button. It navigates and it pre-fills; the press that queues the action is
 * always the player's, on the game's own control, and the walk only advances
 * once the server has answered that press with an `actions_updated` naming the
 * action the step asked for. Nothing is chained, nothing fires on a timer.
 *
 * A step the plan says to buy rather than craft opens the marketplace on that
 * item instead, and waits for the item to actually arrive in the inventory
 * before moving on — the purchase, like the queue press, is the player's.
 *
 * A step may also name an item that has to be *selected* before its count means
 * anything — an alchemy action is one action for every item in the game, and the
 * item is chosen in a slot the game gives no handler for. Such a step navigates
 * to the action and then waits, without pre-filling, until the panel itself says
 * the named item is in the slot: a count typed against the wrong item is a count
 * the player did not ask for, and the press that follows it is theirs.
 *
 * The walk lives in memory only: a reload ends it, a character switch ends it,
 * and Stop ends it. Nothing about it is written anywhere.

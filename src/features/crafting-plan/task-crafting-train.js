/**
 * Several tasks, one crafting walk.
 *
 * Two tasks that both end in leather goods do not need two walks. They share the
 * tanning, and often the hide underneath it: walked separately the player queues
 * the same intermediate twice, at two half-counts, with the second run's
 * materials bought as if the first had never happened. Walked together the shared
 * legs are crafted once, at the summed count, and only the tasks' own final
 * actions differ. Adapted from MWITools taskTrainPlanner, CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, see
 * third-party/mwitools/.
 *
 * MWITools buckets tasks by the root of a strictly linear upgrade chain. A
 * Toolasha plan is a tree from `computeBestCraftingPlan` — several inputs per
 * node, buy-vs-craft decided per leg — so there is no single root to bucket on.
 * The equivalent here is to plan each task's target on its own and merge the
 * resulting trees under one shared surplus ledger, then turns that tree into a
 * dependency-ordered step list. This also keeps overproduced output from one
 * task available to the next task in the merged walk.
 *
 * The walk itself is untouched: it takes a step list, and a merged list is still
 * a step list. Nothing here presses a game button either.

 * is only ordered against itself, so a step one plan reaches late can land after
 * a step the other plan has consuming it. (A: buy hide, craft leather, craft hat.
 * B: buy hide, buy dye, craft leather, craft boots. Concatenated and deduped, the
 * dye arrives after the leather that has already been crafted.)
 *
 * So the order is rebuilt rather than spliced. Every plan contributes edges
 * `child → nearest emitted ancestor` — the ancestor rather than the parent
 * because a node the plan emits no step for (a coin, a zero leg) must not break
 * the chain from its children to whatever does consume them — and the merged
 * list is a topological order of that union. A step therefore precedes every step
 * that consumes it *in any plan*, which is the property the merge needs and the
 * one concatenation loses. Among steps that are ready at the same time the
 * earliest first appearance wins, so the result stays deterministic and as close
 * to the per-plan post-order as the constraints allow.
 *
 * Recipes are acyclic, but two plans' edges are only checked for cycles together:

 * only here. Such a set has no valid order at all, so it is refused rather than
 * ordered wrongly.

/**
 * The gold source attribution panel.
 *
 * A stacked bar per day and a totals table, opened from the coin button beside
 * the net worth history chart.
 *
 * ## What the drawing is trying to say
 *
 * Each day's bar is the day's *measured* net worth change, cut into the pieces
 * the recordings can account for — plus one grey piece, the residual, which is
 * everything they cannot. The grey is not an error bar and not a rounding
 * remainder: it is market movement, activity older than a recorder's window,
 * and activity nothing records. Drawing it at the same weight as the rest is
 * the whole point of the panel; a chart whose colors summed to the total would
 * be claiming a certainty that does not exist.
 *
 * Sources that cost coins — consumables burned, market tax paid — are negative,
 * and are drawn at the left of the bar and dimmed, so a day where the food bill
 * ate the drops looks like what it was rather than like a shorter good day.
 *
 * ## Tooltips
 *
 * Every source names the recording it came from and the date that recording
 * starts, because "you earned nothing from production last week" and "nothing
 * was recording production last week" are completely different statements and
 * the numbers alone cannot tell them apart.
 *
 * That distinction is why the combat row's Basis cell no longer says a flat
 * "Measured": combat is fed by the loot log where it spoke and by the archived
 * battle runs where it did not, and a day neither covered is a gap the row says
 * out loud rather than a zero it reports with confidence.

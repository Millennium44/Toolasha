/**
 * Gold source attribution.
 *
 * ## The question
 *
 * The net worth history says the account is worth eight hundred million more
 * than it was a week ago. It does not say where that came from, and the honest
 * answer is that nothing in this script knows for certain: net worth is a
 * valuation of everything owned, and it moves when the market moves as readily
 * as when the player earns anything.
 *
 * What the script *does* have is several independent recordings of activity —
 * the loot log, the alchemy session stores, the enhancement sessions, the trade
 * ledger, and (new, alongside this) a per-day production recorder. Each of them
 * can be turned into a number of coins. Adding them up gives a figure that
 * explains *some* of the net worth delta.
 *
 * ## The residual is the point
 *
 * The difference between the measured net worth delta and the sum of the
 * attributed sources is reported as a residual and never distributed across the
 * sources to make the table balance. A residual is real information:
 *
 * - market movement — everything owned repriced, which no activity caused;
 * - activity older than a recorder's coverage window (the loot log keeps five
 *   hundred entries, the combat session history twenty runs);
 * - activity nothing records at all (quests, task rewards, chest opens,
 *   guild contributions, gifts);
 * - valuation drift, because every source here is priced at *today's* market,
 *   not at the price on the day it happened.
 *
 * A balancing plug hides all four. The residual names them.
 *
 * ## Naming them is not the same as reading them
 *
 * A single grey number still cannot say WHICH of the four it was, and two
 * readings alongside it can:
 *
 * - the **category decomposition** ({@link categoryBreakdown}) differences the
 *   per-asset fields of the same two closes the day's delta comes from, so a
 *   day reads "the whole change is item valuation" or "coins arrived from
 *   something nothing records" rather than only "unexplained";
 * - the **market movement estimate** ({@link marketMovement}) uses the
 *   item-level detail snapshots, each of which priced its holdings at the time
 *   it was taken, to measure price drift on stock held through the last day —
 *   the one thing the today's-prices caveat says this cannot see.
 *
 * Neither is subtracted from anything. The residual stays exactly as large as
 * it falls out.
 *
 * ## Combat has three recordings, and no drop is counted twice
 *
 * - the **battle feed, recorded live** (`combat-loot-recorder.js`): every
 *   `new_battle` carries the run's running loot total, and it is read whenever
 *   the game is open, whatever panel is showing;
 * - the **loot log**, the game's own record, but only sent while its Loot & XP
 *   Log panel is open — so often a stale early snapshot of a run, or nothing;
 * - the **archived runs**, the twenty most recent, plus the one in progress.
 *
 * All three are readings of the same running total — the game counts a run's
 * loot from its `combatStartTime`, and the loot log counts an action's drops
 * from the same start — so they are gathered under the run they recorded and
 * each run is costed as the most any of them had seen by each instant (see
 * {@link combatLootByDay}). Whichever saw furthest into a stretch of time
 * answers for it and the others add only what it missed: the live feed for
 * the hours the tab was open, the loot log or archive for the tail after it
 * closed. A run's total is the most one recording saw, never a sum of two.
 *
 * The offline period belongs to the offline row: the Welcome Back summary is
 * the server's own item delta for it, drops and food included, and a combat
 * recording that ran through it carries the same drops. Every combat recording
 * leaves its share of an offline window to that row.
 *
 * Days no recording covers are counted and reported rather than left to look
 * like days of no combat, and what they were worth stays in the residual.
 *
 * What combat COST is reconciled the same way, from two recordings rather than
 * three: the live record of every combat food and drink whose count fell while
 * the game was open (`item-flow-recorder.js`), and the same twenty archived
 * runs, each carrying its own estimate of what it consumed. A run counts the
 * most either saw, never their sum — see {@link combatConsumablesByDay}.
 *
 * ## Days are local
 *
 * A day here means the day the user experienced, midnight to midnight in
 * their own timezone — the same keying the net worth calendar uses. Storage
 * still CHUNKS some histories by UTC day (`utils/chunked-history.js`), but a
 * chunk id is where a record lives, not what day its own timestamp belongs
 * to; every entry is re-bucketed here from its timestamp.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Nothing here reads storage, the DOM or the market. Prices arrive as a
 * `price(itemHrid, enhancementLevel)` callback and the recordings arrive as
 * plain arrays, so the arithmetic that decides what a week of play was worth is
 * testable without a game running behind it.

/**
 * What your own filled orders did to net worth, and the tax they paid, per local day.
 *
 * Every row here prices at today's market, and so does this: a fill is an
 * exchange of coins for items (or items for coins), and the net worth moved by
 * the difference between the coins and what net worth carries the items at.
 *
 * - a **buy** adds `value × quantity − coins paid`: buying under the valuation
 *   is a gain the day it fills, buying at an ask above it a loss;
 * - a **sell** adds `gross − value × quantity`, and its tax goes to the tax row,
 *   so the two lines sum to the coins that landed less the items that left.
 *
 * Both sides are counted on the day they fill, whether or not the other side
 * was ever recorded, which is what keeps this in step with the rows that consume
 * or produce the same items at the same valuation: an input bought and crafted
 * away counts its buy gap here and its valuation in the production row, and the
 * two sum to what the account actually paid.
 *
 * A fill whose item net worth cannot value is left out of the figure and
 * counted; its tax is real coins either way and still counts.
 *
 * @param {Array<Object>} fills - Trade ledger fill records, any order
 * @param {number} marketTax - Sell tax rate, e.g. MARKET_TAX
 * @param {Function} [value] - `(itemHrid, enhancementLevel) => number|null`, what net
 *   worth carries one unit at

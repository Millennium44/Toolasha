/**
 * Production and offline income, recorded per day.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * Every other source the gold attribution reads is already written down
 * somewhere: combat and gathering drops in the loot log, alchemy in its session
 * stores, enhancing in its sessions, trades in the ledger. Production is not.
 * The loot log does record what a cooking action produced, but never what it
 * consumed — and a production action that turns two hundred thousand of inputs
 * into two hundred and ten thousand of outputs added ten thousand to the
 * account, not two hundred and ten. Reading only the log would report the
 * gross as income and overstate a day of crafting several times over.
 *
 * So this records both halves as the actions complete, and stores the day's
 * running totals.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot see
 *
 * The recipe and the number of actions completed are known exactly; the outputs
 * are what the recipe says they are. Rare extra drops from a production action
 * are *not* counted here — they land in the loot log, and counting them in both
 * places would be worse than counting them in neither. This is why the
 * attribution panel labels production as an estimate and everything else as
 * measured.
 *
 * Offline progress is recorded from the Welcome Back payload as it arrives.
 * Nothing that happened before this recorder existed can be recovered, which is
 * what the panel's coverage line is for.
 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * One record per calendar month in the `networthHistory` store, holding one
 * small row per day. A day's row is rewritten as the day goes on; every earlier
 * month is settled and never touched again (see `utils/chunked-history.js`).
 * Deliberately not a new object store: adding one costs a database version bump,
 * and a per-month record beside the net worth series it is read with fits the
 * store's key budget without one.

/**
 * Combat loot, recorded as it happens.
 *
 * ## Why the other two recordings are not enough
 *
 * The gold attribution's combat row had two sources, and both have a hole the
 * size of normal play:
 *
 * - the **loot log** is only sent while the game's own Loot & XP Log panel is
 *   open, so a character who never opens it records nothing, and one who opened
 *   it for the first hour of a ten-hour run has a one-hour entry for the whole
 *   run;
 * - the **archived runs** keep the twenty most recent, so a month of short runs
 *   reaches back a week, and a run is only archived when the next one starts.
 *
 * Every `new_battle` the game sends while the tab is open carries the player's
 * `totalLootMap` — the running total for the combat action in progress, from its
 * `combatStartTime`. That is the whole of what is needed: read it every time it
 * arrives, and the combat row is recorded whenever the game is open, whatever
 * panel happens to be showing, for as long as this record is kept.
 *
 * ## Checkpoints, not increments
 *
 * What is stored is the running total itself, twice per run per local day: the
 * first reading of the day and the last. Not the difference between readings —
 * a difference is already a decision about which day it belongs to, and that
 * decision needs things this module does not have (what the loot log and the
 * archive saw of the same run, and when the character was offline, which the
 * Welcome Back summary already counts). Stored as readings, the attribution can
 * lay every recording of one run on one timeline and take, at each instant, the
 * most any of them saw — so no drop is counted twice however many recordings
 * saw it. See `combatRunDayValues` in `gold-sources.js`.
 *
 * With the tab open across midnight the last reading of one day and the first of
 * the next are seconds apart, so the split between days is exact. A stretch the
 * tab was closed for is a gap between two readings, and the loot that arrived in
 * it is spread across it by time — the same estimate every other session here
 * uses, now confined to the part nobody watched.
 *
 * ## Offline windows
 *
 * The Welcome Back summary (`offlineItems` on `init_character_data`) is the
 * server's own signed item delta for the offline period, and the offline row
 * already counts it — drops and the food eaten alike. A combat run that carried
 * on through the offline period comes back with those same drops in its running
 * total, so the window is recorded here too, and the attribution leaves every
 * combat recording's share of it to the offline row rather than counting it on
 * both.
 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * One record per local day in the `networthHistory` store, day-chunked rather
 * than month-chunked like the other recorders here: this one is written on
 * every battle, and a month of combat checkpoints is too much to re-serialise
 * that often.

/**
 * Inventory movements the attribution cannot get from any other record,
 * recorded as they happen.
 *
 * ## Why a mirror of the inventory
 *
 * `items_updated` and `action_completed` carry ABSOLUTE counts for the rows that
 * changed, never deltas, and by the time a listener hears either message the
 * data manager has already written the new count over the old one. So this keeps
 * its own last-seen count per inventory row and diffs each message against it.
 * The mirror is seeded from the whole inventory whenever the character is
 * initialised (login, reconnect, switch), so a Welcome Back summary's gains are
 * never read as a delta: the offline row counts those.
 *
 * ## Gathering
 *
 * The loot log is only sent while its panel is open. Every `action_completed`
 * of a gathering action carries the items it gained, so while the tab is open
 * the gathered drops are recorded whatever panel is showing. Only the positive
 * deltas of that message are credited, and only when the completed action is a
 * gathering one: a marketplace claim, a chest opened or a craft arrives in a
 * different message or under a different action and is never gathering.
 *
 * What is stored is the gain of each unbroken stretch the tab watched, per
 * action and per local day. The attribution lays these beside the loot log's
 * running total for the same action and takes, per span, the most either saw
 * (see `gatheringByDay` in `gold-sources.js`).
 *
 * ## Dungeon keys
 *
 * A dungeon run takes one entry key from each member's inventory as it starts.
 * The count alone cannot tell that from listing a key on the market, which
 * lowers it the same way (`utils/key-ledger.js`), so a fall is only counted as
 * spent when all of these hold:
 *
 * - it is a fall of exactly one — one run, one key;
 * - a dungeon that takes that key is running, either when the fall arrives or
 *   within `CONFIRM_MS` of it (the key goes as the run starts, and the message
 *   that makes the dungeon the running action can come second);
 * - no listing of that key is seen within `CONFIRM_MS` either side of it.
 *
 * Each guard can only make a real run go uncounted, never make a listing count.
 *
 * ## Skilling drinks
 *
 * A drink is used up from the inventory, one at a time, and the count falls by
 * one when it is. The same guards apply, with the drink's slot in place of the
 * dungeon: a fall of exactly one, of a drink sitting in an active drink slot of
 * the running non-combat action's type (now or within `CONFIRM_MS`), with no
 * listing of it alongside. One more keeps other consumption out: a fall inside
 * the completed action's own message, of an item that action takes as an input,
 * is the recipe's (the production recorder's), not a drink.
 *
 * ## Combat food and drink
 *
 * The same fall, under a combat action: food and drinks go one at a time and
 * arrive as a plain `items_updated` with no completed action at all. Every
 * guard above is reused unchanged — a fall of exactly one, unenhanced, of an
 * item in an ACTIVE COMBAT food or drink slot while a combat action is running
 * (now or within `CONFIRM_MS`), with no listing of it alongside and no recipe
 * of the completed action taking it as an input. Which tally a fall books to is
 * decided once, by the slot it sits in and the action that is running, so no
 * fall can be counted as both a skilling drink and a combat consumable.
 *
 * Unlike the two tallies above, this one keeps the TIME of what it saw, as the
 * gathering record does: each unbroken watched stretch and what it used up. The
 * archived runs record the same consumption (`combat-session-history.js`, the
 * twenty most recent), and the attribution lays the two beside each other and
 * takes, per run, the most either saw rather than their sum — see
 * `combatConsumablesByDay` in `gold-sources.js`. A stretch is broken by silence
 * and by the run changing, so one stretch never straddles two runs.
 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * One record per local day in the `networthHistory` store, day-chunked for the
 * same reason as `combat-loot-recorder.js`: it is written on every completion.
 *
 * A day's row is rewritten all day, so two devices can each hold a different
 * copy of it. A sync pull folds two copies of a chunk by union, and the union
 * cannot tell two versions of one row from two rows: both are kept, and every
 * reader summed them — the gathering, drinks and keys of the copy that was
 * pulled counted twice. `mergeDayRows` folds them back into one on every load.

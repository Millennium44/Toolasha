/**
 * Price Target Alerts
 *
 * Says so when a pinned item's price comes to where you asked it to — "tell me
 * under 4.2M ask" on a watchlist chip, and then you can stop looking.
 *
 * The price panel's chips have always shown the number and the move; what they
 * could not do is watch it for you. A pin without a target is still just a
 * number you have to go and read, and the whole reason to name a price is so
 * that nobody has to sit on the marketplace tab waiting for it.
 *
 * ## Where the reading comes from
 *
 * The pooled Mooket dataset, and nothing else. This is the one deliberate
 * difference from `savings-goal-alerts.js`, and it is the same rule
 * `market-undercut-alerts.js` keeps: the claim here is *entirely* about a
 * market figure, so a figure that cannot be dated proves nothing. The game's
 * own `marketplace.json` refreshes about hourly, and the price store folds it in
 * stamped with the moment it was folded rather than the moment it was true — an
 * honest enough basis for a chip that says "updated N ago" about its own cache,
 * and not an honest basis for "the ask is under your target right now". A Mooket
 * sighting carries the time it was actually seen, which is the only timestamp
 * worth gating on.
 *
 * So: a sighting older than {@link marketAPI.CACHE_DURATION} fires nothing, and
 * every message carries the sighting's true age. And because the pool is what
 * supplies those sightings, **the alert is quiet whenever the price history
 * feature is off** — there is then no dated evidence at all, and the pins
 * themselves live in that panel. The setting's help text says so outright
 * rather than leaving a switched-on alert to be silently inert.
 *
 * ## Repeats
 *
 * One armed bit per pin, on the discipline `market-undercut-alerts.js`
 * documents. The bit disarms on the first announcement and re-arms when a fresh
 * sighting shows the price back on the wrong side of the target — or when the
 * target itself changes, which resets the pin's state entirely: moving a target
 * from 4.2M to 3.8M is a new intention, not the old one restated. As there, a
 * target change bumps a generation counter that rides in the event key, so the
 * service's cooldown on the old target cannot eat the new target's news.
 *
 * A pin whose side the market is not quoting leaves its bit exactly as it was.
 * An empty book is unknown, not "still above your price", and re-arming on it
 * would announce the same crossing twice.

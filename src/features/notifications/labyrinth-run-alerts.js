/**
 * Labyrinth Stopped Alerts
 *
 * Says so when the character stops doing the labyrinth — the queued rooms ran
 * out, or the run ended on a lost fight — and moves on to whatever was queued
 * behind it, or to nothing. That is the one moment a lab run has that nothing
 * in the game announces, and the moment you are least likely to be looking,
 * because a run you are watching is a run you are steering.
 *
 * ## What "stopped" means here
 *
 * The character's current action was a labyrinth action and now is not. That
 * is read off the action queue, not off the run's `isActive` flag: a run whose
 * queued path has been walked stays *active* while the character wanders off
 * to the next thing in the queue, and that is exactly the case worth a tap on
 * the shoulder — the run is still there, waiting for more rooms to be queued.
 * Walking out of the labyrinth on purpose also ends the action, but you are at
 * the screen for that, and the service keeps an alert for a tab you are
 * looking at quiet anyway.
 *
 * ## Why the text does not say *why*
 *
 * Because the server does not: there is no outcome, result or reason field on
 * a labyrinth message. The floor reached is the score of a lab run, so that is
 * what gets reported, with what the character is doing instead.
 *
 * ## Once per stop
 *
 * Keyed on the transition, not the state: a character who is not in the
 * labyrinth is the resting case and is never news. Each stop announces once;
 * queuing the labyrinth again re-arms it.
 *
 * The counter behind that key never restarts, and the key names the character
 * as well. The service's de-duplication window is ten minutes and its map is
 * shared across bundles and outlives a character switch, so a counter that went
 * back to zero on teardown handed the arriving character a key the departing
 * one had just used — and the first stop after every switch was silently
 * swallowed as a duplicate.

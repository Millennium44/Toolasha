/**
 * Savings Goal Alerts
 *
 * Says so when something on your savings list becomes affordable.
 *
 * The savings panel has always known this — `savingsProgress` returns
 * `affordable` alongside the bar fraction, and every row on the list is costed
 * against your spendable coins on every redraw. But the panel is the only place
 * that reads it, and the panel is a panel: it tells you the moment you open it,
 * which is never the moment it happened. Saving for a late-game piece is a
 * week-long affair, and the whole point of a goal is to stop checking.
 *
 * ## Where the reading comes from
 *
 * The same three lists the panel draws — `watchedTargets` for gear,
 * `watchedAbilityGoals` for ability levels, `watchedHouseGoals` for house rooms
 * — so a goal is affordable here exactly when the panel would draw it as
 * affordable, including every subtlety the panel already settled: the trade-in
 * value of the piece you are replacing, coins tied up in market orders counted
 * or not per your setting, and a craft costed from its inputs rather than its
 * ask.
 *
 * A goal the character has already *reached* without buying it — an ability read
 * up to level over a week of drops, a room built out of materials in hand — is
 * skipped rather than announced. The panel costs those at zero, which makes them
 * permanently "affordable", and announcing that would be announcing something
 * that already happened and was already visible.
 *
 * ## The price's age
 *
 * A cost is a pile of market figures, and market figures go stale: the game's
 * `marketplace.json` refreshes about hourly and this script's cache holds it for
 * fifteen minutes, so "you can afford this now" can rest on a quote from this
 * morning. Every message carries the age of the figure behind it, and a figure
 * older than the cache window says so outright, exactly as the undercut alert
 * does. The alert still fires on a stale quote — unlike the undercut alert,
 * which stays silent, because there the stale figure is the *whole* claim while
 * here the coins in your purse are real and only the price is in doubt — but it
 * never lets the player mistake an old quote for a current one.
 *
 * ## Repeats
 *
 * One armed bit per goal, on the discipline `market-undercut-alerts.js`
 * documents. The bit disarms on the first announcement and re-arms when the
 * situation reverses — you spend the coins, or a price moves the goal back out
 * of reach — or when the target itself changes, which resets the goal's state
 * entirely: raising an ability goal from Lv46 to Lv51 is a new intention, not
 * the old one restated. As there, a target change also bumps a generation
 * counter that rides in the event key, so the service's cooldown on the old
 * target cannot eat the new target's news.
 *
 * A goal that cannot be costed at all leaves its bit exactly as it was. An
 * unpriced target is unknown rather than unaffordable, and treating it as the
 * latter would re-arm a goal every time the market failed to quote it and
 * announce it again on the next quote that landed.

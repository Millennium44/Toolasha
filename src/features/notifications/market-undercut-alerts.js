/**
 * Market Undercut Alerts
 *
 * Says so when a sell listing of yours is no longer the best ask — someone has
 * posted cheaper, and your listing sits behind theirs until you reprice — and
 * symmetrically when a buy order of yours is no longer the best bid.
 *
 * ## Where the comparison comes from
 *
 * Your side is the game's own `myMarketListings`, kept current by the data
 * manager on every `market_listings_updated`; only listings the server calls
 * active are compared, because a filled or cancelled listing has no price to
 * defend. The market's side is the freshest of two figures: the marketplace API
 * cache — the API snapshot patched by any order book you have opened since — and,
 * when the price history panel is on, the newest sighting of the item in the
 * pooled Mooket dataset. That second source is what makes the alert work
 * passively: the game's `marketplace.json` refreshes only about once an hour, so
 * for an item you have not opened its snapshot is usually older than the fifteen
 * minutes a figure is allowed to be and still count — the undercut is real but
 * unprovable, and the alert stays silent. A Mooket sighting is typically minutes
 * old, so it clears that bar.
 *
 * Every message carries the true age of whichever figure it used, a figure older
 * than the fifteen-minute window proves nothing and fires nothing, and an item
 * neither source can price is unknown rather than undercut.
 *
 * ## Repeats
 *
 * One armed bit per listing (the `listingBeaten` predicate) makes each undercut
 * one event: the bit disarms on the first announcement and re-arms only when
 * the situation resolves — you reprice, or the undercutter's stock sells out
 * and your price is best again — or when you edit the listing, which resets its
 * state entirely. The event key carries the listing id, so the service's
 * cooldown throttles each listing separately and a noisy market cannot spend
 * one listing's silence on another's news.

/**
 * Guild trial alerts
 *
 * Two moments in a trial week are worth interrupting somebody for, and both of
 * them are moments the player cannot see coming from inside the game: a trial
 * they signed up for is about to start, and the one they were in has finished
 * and paid out.
 *
 * ## Where the times come from
 *
 * Not from a socket message — there isn't one. The guild panel states the cycle
 * in words at the top of its trial tabs ("Scheduled Wed 04:00 PM 2h 24m",
 * "Completed Thu 09:00 AM"), and `guild-trials-scrape.js` reads it. So this
 * module is *pushed to* by the trials feature rather than watching anything
 * itself, which keeps the dependency running one way — a notifications module
 * that imported the guild feature would be a cycle, and the guild feature
 * already imports this one.
 *
 * The panel only reports its countdown while it is open, but the starting alert
 * does not need it open at the moment of firing: the first scheduled reading
 * fixes the start as an absolute instant (**seen time + time-till-start**) and a
 * timer is armed for the lead moment against that instant, so closing the panel
 * afterwards does not silence the warning. A player who never opens the panel
 * during a cycle still gets nothing — there is no schedule to anchor to until it
 * has been seen once — but one glimpse is enough, where before the panel had to
 * be open across the whole lead window.
 *
 * ## Re-arming
 *
 * Keyed by the phase transition rather than by a timestamp: the same cycle
 * cannot announce its own start twice, and the next cycle is a different
 * transition. The service's own cooldown catches anything this misses.

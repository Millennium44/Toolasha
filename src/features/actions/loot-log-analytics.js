/**
 * Loot log analytics
 *
 * What the actions in the loot log actually paid, added up.
 *
 * Every other XP/hr and gold/hr figure in this script is *predicted*: a rate the
 * action calculators derive from game data and a character's buffs. This is the
 * one view built the other way round — from what the game recorded happening,
 * across the current session and everything storage still holds. When the two
 * disagree the calibration panel says whether the model is wrong; this says what
 * the action paid, which is a different question and the one asked first.
 *
 * Aggregation only. Nothing here touches the DOM, storage or game data — callers
 * resolve names, icons and prices from the hrids on the rows that come back — so
 * the arithmetic can be tested without a page around it.

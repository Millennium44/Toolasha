/**
 * Buff board
 *
 * What is actually boosting you right now, how much, and from where.
 *
 * The game states the answer eight times over and shows it nowhere. Every
 * source of a bonus — the tea in the slot, the gear, the house room, the
 * achievement tier, the MooPass, the guild shrine, the community donation, the
 * labyrinth seal — arrives as its own map on `characterData`, keyed by action
 * type, and each map is read separately by whichever calculator needed it. So
 * "why is my efficiency 61%" is a question the script could always answer and
 * never did: the numbers were in eight places and the player was in none of
 * them.
 *
 * This is one board for the action type the character is running, with a
 * selector for looking at another. One card per source, one row per buff: what
 * it boosts, by how much, and which thing granted it.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is derived
 *
 * Every figure is the `flatBoost`/`ratioBoost` the server states, printed. The
 * boosts are not summed across sources, because the sources do not all stack
 * the same way and a total would be a claim this module is not in a position to
 * make — `utils/efficiency.js` and `utils/action-calculator.js` own that
 * arithmetic. Nor are the level-bonus fields folded in: every existing reader
 * (`getAchievementBuffFlatBoost`, the guild sums in `action-calculator.js`)
 * takes the boost as stated, because the server has already resolved it.
 *
 * ## There is no expiry on the wire
 *
 * Every entry carries `startTime: '0001-01-01T00:00:00Z'` and a `duration`
 * that is the item type's fixed span, not a remaining time — a wisdom tea
 * reads 250 s whether it was drunk now or four minutes ago. The drink slots
 * say `isActive: true, duration: 0` while a drink is running, so they carry no
 * countdown either. So this board shows no countdown. What it does show is the
 * supply estimate `drink-calculator.js` already computes for the drink timer —
 * how long the stock lasts — labelled as the estimate it is, which is a
 * different question from when the current cup wears off.
 *
 * ## Combat is a different source
 *
 * `consumableActionTypeBuffsMap['/action_types/combat']` has been observed null
 * with three coffees active and slotted (captured on the test server,
 * 2026-09-11), while `ability-timing-calculator.js` reads that same slot for
 * Channeling Coffee's cast speed and expects it to be there. Rather than pick a
 * side, this reads the map first and falls back to the source the in-battle
 * buff bars use: `battle_updated` carries each unit's `combatBuffMap`, in the
 * same `{typeHrid, ratioBoost, flatBoost}` shape, and the drinks are in it. If
 * neither has anything, the board says so and names what is slotted, rather
 * than drawing an empty table that reads as "no buffs".

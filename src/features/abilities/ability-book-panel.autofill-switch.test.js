/** @vitest-environment happy-dom
 *
 * The armed buy quantity, across a character switch.
 *
 * "Buy books" arms the marketplace autofill with *this* character's shortfall
 * and then navigates away. The arming is one-shot but not time-bounded: it
 * waits for a buy box for that book to actually open, which is a trip to the
 * marketplace and any number of clicks later — comfortably long enough for the
 * player to change character on the way. Nothing dropped it when they did, so
 * the arriving character's New Buy Listing for that book came up with the
 * departed character's count already typed in.
 *
 * The real `createAutofillManager` is used here, and its own read API is the
 * assertion: a mock could only show that a call was made, and what matters is
 * that the number is gone from the closure that would fill the box.

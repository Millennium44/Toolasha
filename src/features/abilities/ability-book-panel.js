/**
 * Ability Book panel
 *
 * Every ability at once: what its next level costs in books, and which of them
 * is the cheapest thing you could buy right now.
 *
 * The Item Dictionary already answers this for one ability — the one whose book
 * you happen to be looking at. That is the wrong shape for the question people
 * actually ask, which is not "what does this cost" but "what should I buy". You
 * cannot answer the second by opening the first eighteen times.
 *
 * ## Cheapest is not nearest
 *
 * The ability closest to its next level is rarely the cheapest to level. Books
 * differ in the experience they grant and by orders of magnitude in price, so
 * the ability two hundred experience from a level can cost more than one four
 * thousand away. The panel sorts by cost for that reason, and the overlay row
 * carries the winner.
 *
 * An unpriced book is **unknown, not free**. Treating a missing price as zero
 * would make whatever nobody is selling win every time, which is precisely
 * backwards. Those rows say so and are excluded from the cheapest.
 *
 * The arithmetic is in `utils/ability-books.js`, shared with the dictionary
 * calculator so the two cannot disagree about the same number.
 *
 * The panel is BRead's, from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

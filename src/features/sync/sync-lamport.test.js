/**
 * The ordering counter, and the fleet it has to keep working.
 *
 * These are compatibility tests before they are feature tests. A gist is a file
 * two builds share for as long as the player leaves one device un-updated, so
 * every scenario here is a combination that must survive: a gist with no
 * counter, a build that has never heard of one, and the two mixed indefinitely.
 *
 * Devices are modelled explicitly rather than by re-importing the manager,
 * because what distinguishes two devices is exactly the three things swapped in
 * `as()`: their own bookkeeping, their own data, and their own clock.

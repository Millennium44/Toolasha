/**
 * Cross-device sync.
 *
 * Two devices, one account, and no server of ours: the settings and history
 * this script accumulates live in IndexedDB, which is per-browser, so a second
 * machine starts empty and a reinstall starts empty again. This carries them
 * across via a single private GitHub gist that the user owns, using a personal
 * access token they supply.
 *
 * The conflict model is deliberately small. Every payload carries an
 * `exportedAt`, newest wins, and the only case that asks a question is the one
 * where both sides moved: the remote is newer than what this device last
 * exchanged *and* this device has changed since then. Anything else resolves
 * without a dialog, because a sync that interrogates you on startup is a sync
 * you turn off.
 *
 * Applying a payload is not an overwrite. Records that can only grow — chest
 * tallies, market listings, XP series, trial records, labyrinth runs — are
 * combined with this device's copy key by key (see `sync-payload.js` and
 * `utils/sync-merge-registry.js`), because there is no reading of "take the
 * remote copy" under which throwing away entries the remote has never seen is
 * what anyone meant. What the conflict dialog actually decides is the fate of
 * the records that *cannot* be combined — settings, watchlists, plans — and
 * whether the union goes straight back up to the gist.
 *
 * "Has this device changed" is answered by fingerprinting the payload rather
 * than by watching writes. Watching writes would mean a hook on every store; the
 * fingerprint costs one build of a payload we were about to build anyway.
 *
 * Everything fails soft. A missing token, a spent rate limit, a plane with no
 * wifi — each is a toast and a no-op, never a thrown error into whatever called
 * us, and never a partial write.

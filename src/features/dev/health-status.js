 * they are not looking at. This is the other end of that: the aggregate toast
 * leads here, and here leads to a report somebody can paste into a bug thread.
 *
 * The report reuses the startup trace rather than inventing a second format. A
 * feature that failed and the ten seconds the page spent waiting for IndexedDB

 * Was the page running when an operation failed to come back?

 * The question these lines exist to answer, and it cannot be answered from the
 * counters above or from `pformance-panel.js` — that one measures main-thread
 * stalls, and an IndexedDB wait is off-thread and invisible to it. Two readings
 * sit beside every timeout, and both are needed:
 *
 * - `visible/hidden` and how long ago the tab changed. A backgrounded tab is
 *   throttled and eventually runs nothing at all, so neither IndexedDB's event
 *   nor the watchdog's own timeout can be delivered; on resume the expired
 *   timeout runs first and beats a healthy transaction.
 * - `lost`: wall time the page failed to account for, from a one-second
 *   heartbeat. A foreground tab on a saturated machine loses time in exactly
 *   the same way while reading `visible` throughout — which is why a `visible`
 *   reading here is not an alibi.
 *
 * So: timeouts with lost time against them, or within a second of a visibility
 * change, are a page that was not running. Timeouts with neither, clustered on
 * one store, are real contention on that store — and the per-store histogram
 * and the write-rate list below say which writer is doing it.

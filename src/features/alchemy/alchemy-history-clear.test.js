/**
 * What "clear my alchemy history" does when the store refuses the delete.
 *
 * `ChunkedHistory.clear()` answers `false` for a clear that did not happen —
 * a store that could not be listed, or deletes that were refused — and the
 * viewers report that instead of emptying the table. The trackers dropped the
 * in-progress session before asking, so a refused clear lost the attempts
 * recorded since that session started while leaving on disk the history the
 * user had asked to delete: nothing deleted, and something lost.

/**
 * The panel's own state, and the two rules it keeps.
 *
 * Every key is per character — an iron cow's plan is not the main's — and the
 * only thing that can be stored is a tick that is on. A tick turned off is
 * removed rather than written as `false`, so a stale `false` can never sit in
 * storage arguing with a stage the character has since finished.

/**
 * What the Star Fruit loop earns an iron cow, and what that buys in cowbells.
 *
 * ## The one constraint that shapes everything here
 *
 * An iron cow cannot sell on the marketplace. It can only *buy* — and in
 * practice only cowbells. So every market sell price in the repository is the
 * wrong number for this loop: nothing in it is ever sold. The fruit is
 * decomposed, the essence is coinified, and the only gold that exists comes out
 * of coinify, whose output is `sellPrice × bulkMultiplier × 5` — the game's own
 * vendor formula, not a market quote.
 *
 * This module therefore reads three things and only three things out of the
 * calculators it composes:
 *
 *  - **rates** — items and actions per hour, which are price-independent;
 *  - **coinify's coin output**, which is the vendor formula above;
 *  - **the decompose coin fee**, from `utils/alchemy-fees.js`.
 *
 * It never reads `profitPerHour`, `revenuePerHour`, `materialCost` or any
 * `dropRevenues[].price` off those results, because every one of those is a
 * market valuation of something this character cannot sell. `loopBasis()` says
 * so in one line for anything that wants to check, and the tests assert it by
 * moving every market price and watching the loop not move.
 *
 * ## Why the loop is costed per fruit and not per hour
 *
 * The three actions do not run at once. They queue, and the queue runs one at a
 * time, so an hour of "the loop" is an hour split between foraging, decomposing
 * and coinifying in whatever ratio keeps the fruit moving. The honest unit is
 * therefore one fruit all the way through: the time it takes to forage, the time
 * to decompose, the time to coinify what came out, and the coins at the end.
 * Gold per hour is that divided by that.
 *
 * ## Why no catalyst
 *
 * The alchemy calculator's default is a search over six catalyst-and-tea
 * combinations, priced at market. An iron cow cannot buy a catalyst, so a quote
 * that assumes one is a quote for a loop it cannot run. The success rates below
 * are recomputed through the calculator's own public
 * `calculateSuccessRateBreakdown` with no catalyst and the character's live tea
 * bonus — teas being self-brewed, and so free. Catalysts found as drops only
 * make the real thing better than this figure.

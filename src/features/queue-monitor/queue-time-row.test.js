/**
 * The Queue Time Left tile.
 *
 * The arithmetic is one line and `action-calculator` is mocked to a flat answer,
 * because what is worth pinning down here is not the multiplication — it is the
 * three shapes of queue the tile has to tell apart. A queue of counted actions
 * has a time. A queue whose running action has no count has no time at all, and
 * must not read as a zero. And a counted action *in front of* an unbounded one
 * has a time, which is time until the queue stops changing rather than time
 * until it empties.

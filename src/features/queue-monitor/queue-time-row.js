/**
 * Queue Time Left overlay row
 *
 * How long before this character runs out of things to do.
 *
 * The queue monitor already answers this question, but only about the
 * characters you are *not* playing — its whole design is a snapshot taken as a
 * character is switched away from, because that is the only moment their skills
 * and equipment are still live. The character in front of you has no snapshot
 * and needs none: everything the estimate wants is loaded right now.
 *
 * So this is the same arithmetic against live data rather than against a stored
 * reading, and it is deliberately its own function rather than a call into
 * `queue-snapshot.js`. That module's copy runs once, inside a
 * `character_switching` handler, over a character who is halfway out of the
 * door; this one runs on the overlay's tick and has to be cheap and reentrant.
 * They agree on the formula — remaining count over the efficiency multiplier,
 * times the action's time — and `utils/efficiency.js` owns the multiplier so
 * the agreement is not two hand-written copies of it.
 *
 * ## Why there is nothing to open
 *
 * `onOpen` is a promise that a panel behind the tile answers the same question
 * in more detail, and the queue monitor's panel does not: it lists other
 * characters and has no view of this one. A tile that opened it would be a tile
 * that answers a double-click with somebody else's queue, which is worse than a
 * tile that does not respond at all.

/**
 * What is left of the current character's action queue.
 *
 * An infinite action is reported rather than counted: it never empties, so a
 * total that silently skipped it would say "12m" about a queue that will still
 * be running tomorrow. Everything queued *behind* an infinite action is in the
 * same position, but it is still counted — the figure is then the time to reach
 * the infinite action, which is the honest reading of "when does the queue
 * change".
 *
 * @returns {{seconds: number, finite: number, queued: number, infinite: boolean}|null}
 *   Null when the game has not loaded enough to say anything

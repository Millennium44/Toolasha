/**
 * Catching a loadout as it goes past.
 *
 * `guild-loadouts.js` knows what a snapshot is and where it is kept. This knows
 * *when* one happens: a unit popup opening, a party assembling for a trial, a
 * combat session ending. It listens, it extracts, it writes, and it does nothing
 * else — so the shapes it reads are testable without a socket and the timing is
 * testable without a stat sheet.
 *
 * ## The popup, twice over
 *
 * The popup is expected to be websocket-fed: `battle_unit_fetched` is the
 * message the client already treats as un-deduplicable because consecutive
 * fetches of *different units* look identical in the first hundred characters,
 * which is only a problem if the thing being fetched is a unit somebody is
 * looking at. When that message arrives with a stat sheet on it, that is the
 * popup's own data and nothing needs reading off the screen.
 *
 * It has not been possible to verify that from a live client, so the modal is
 * read as well — and the two do not fight, because the scrape stands down when a
 * socket snapshot has just landed ({@link POPUP_SOCKET_WINDOW_MS}). If the
 * message does feed the popup, the scrape never runs. If it does not, the scrape
 * is the only thing that produces a snapshot and the feature still works. The
 * cost of being wrong in either direction is nothing.
 *
 * The scrape itself is deliberately structural, in the same discipline the
 * trials scrape uses: no class name is trusted beyond `Modal_`, which is already
 * load-bearing elsewhere in the codebase. A unit popup is *whatever modal shows
 * a name with a level beside it and a column of labelled numbers* — see
 * {@link readUnitPopup}.

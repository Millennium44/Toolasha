/**
 * Reading the guild token exchange off the Guild Shop dialog.
 *
 * The exchange rate a token buys credits at is per credit colour — a token buys
 * ten green credits and a sixtieth of a gold one — and no map in the client data
 * has been observed publishing it. `guild-token-value.js` probes for one and
 * prefers it whenever it answers; this module is what stands between that probe
 * and the `guildTokenCreditRate` setting, which is a guess with a number typed
 * into it.
 *
 * The dialog itself is unambiguous. Opening the Green Guild Credit exchange with
 * a Guild Token selected shows "1 → 10" and names both sides, which is the rate
 * stated by the game in the only place it states it. Reading it there costs one
 * callback on a modal that is already being watched.
 *
 * ## What is read
 *
 * Two strategies, tried in order, because the modal's markup has not been
 * verified field by field:
 *
 * - **the arrow**, `N → M` in the modal's own text, which is how the game writes
 *   an exchange everywhere else it writes one;
 * - **the tiles**, an item tile for each side carrying an `Item_count`.
 *
 * Whichever answers first wins, and the record says which so a wrong reading can
 * be recognised as one rather than argued with. Toolasha's own injected tables
 * write arrows too, so they are stripped before the text is read — otherwise the
 * script would read its own output back and call it game data.
 *
 * ## Why the ratio and not the counts
 *
 * The batches input scales both sides together, so a player who typed 7 into it
 * is looking at "7 → 70" and the rate is still ten. Only the ratio is kept as
 * the rate; the raw counts are kept beside it so the dump command can show what
 * was actually on screen.
 *
 * ## Persistence
 *
 * One record for the whole game rather than one per character: the Guild Shop
 * exchange is not a property of whoever opened it. It lives in `guildHistory`
 * beside the other guild-shaped things, is hydrated once into memory so the
 * valuation — which is synchronous, and called from tooltips — can read it
 * without awaiting anything, and is only written when a reading actually differs
 * from what is already known.

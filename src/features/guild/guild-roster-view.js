/**
 * Guild roster
 *
 * Who is actually carrying the guild, and who has stopped.
 *
 * The game shows each member's total guild XP, which is a career figure: it
 * ranks whoever joined first, not whoever contributed this week, and a member
 * who quit a month ago still sits near the top of it. The tracker has been
 * recording per-member XP over time for its XP/h columns, and that same series
 * answers the questions the total cannot — what share of the last week's XP each
 * member produced, and whose rate has collapsed since yesterday.
 *
 * ## Shares are of what was actually observed
 *
 * A share is one member's XP gain over a window divided by the whole roster's
 * gain over the same window. Members with fewer than two samples in the window
 * contribute nothing to either side rather than counting as zero — the
 * difference between "earned nothing" and "was not being watched" is the whole
 * point of the gone-quiet flag below, and folding the second into the first
 * would make every newly tracked member look idle.
 *
 * ## Gone quiet is a comparison, not a threshold
 *
 * "Idle" cannot be a fixed XP/h, because a strong member coasting still outpaces
 * a weak one going flat out. The flag is each member against *themselves*: a
 * day rate that has collapsed against their own week rate. That catches the
 * member who stopped playing on Tuesday and leaves the steady one alone.
 *
 * The arithmetic below is pure and exported for tests; the tracker is asked for
 * its samples through its read API rather than reaching into storage.

 * gets a row and the history is only consulted for the people on it.

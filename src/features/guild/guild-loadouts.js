/**
 * What other players are actually wearing, as far as it can be seen.
 *
 * Clicking a member's icon in the guild's In Progress view opens the game's unit
 * popup — "Tib - Lv.150", a Battle Info tab and a Stats tab, and behind them a
 * full sheet: five evasions, armor, three resistances, HP and MP regeneration,
 * drop quantity and rare find, training focus, experience bonuses, and the
 * equipped abilities with their levels. It is the only place in the game a guild
 * member's build is visible, and it is gone the moment the popup closes.
 *
 * Nothing else in this script keeps any of it. Skill levels are tracked, and
 * that is all — so "why is that trial failing tier 9" is answered by guesswork
 * about who is under-geared. This writes the sheet down when it goes past.
 *
 * ## Where the numbers come from
 *
 * Two sources, and both are used, because they cover different people:
 *
 * - **`battle_unit_fetched`** is the message the client already treats as
 *   special (`websocket.js` exempts it from de-duplication precisely because
 *   consecutive fetches of different units look alike in the first hundred
 *   characters). It carries a whole `CombatUnit`, which is the popup's own
 *   source, so opening a popup is what produces a snapshot. The same message
 *   type also arrives at the end of a combat session carrying only loot and
 *   experience totals; that variant has no stat sheet and {@link extractLoadout}
 *   returns null for it rather than storing an empty player.
 * - **`new_battle`** names every player in the party and carries their
 *   `combatDetails` — so fighting a trial beside somebody records them without
 *   anybody having to click anything.
 *
 * A popup that turns out not to be websocket-fed is covered by
 * `guild-loadout-capture.js`, which reads the modal's own text with the same
 * found-not-named discipline the trials scrape uses.
 *
 * ## A snapshot is a photograph
 *
 * Every entry carries the moment it was taken and everything that draws one says
 * so. A build seen three weeks ago is not what that member is wearing now, and a
 * stat sheet with no date on it is the single most misleading thing this could
 * store — the numbers are perfectly correct and the claim they imply is false.

/**
 * Stop the character-only key being a mixing bowl.
 *
 * `guildLoadouts_<char>` is written only while the guild's name has not
 * arrived yet — a window of a few seconds at the start of every session. Over
 * many sessions and more than one guild it accumulates everybody the character
 * has ever stood next to, under no guild at all, which is exactly the record
 * that used to be adopted wholesale onto a new guild's key.
 *
 * So once a guild key exists, whatever is *also* under it is dropped from the
 * character-only key: the guild key is the authoritative copy of those
 * sightings and two copies is how they leak. Pruning rather than deleting —
 * anything the guild key has never held stays where it is, since it is the
 * only copy of it and the guild it belongs to cannot be worked out after the
 * fact. Monster sheets go at the same time.
 *
 * @param {string|number|null} characterId - Viewing character id
 * @param {Object|null} guildRecord - The record now held under the guild key
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} The names dropped

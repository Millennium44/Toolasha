/**
 * Guild trials, while they are running.
 *
 * The game's In Progress tab shows a bar and a level. It does not say how fast
 * the bar is moving, whether the tier in front of the party is reachable before
 * the hour ends, what the tier after that will cost, or what any of it is worth
 * when the tokens are paid out on Friday. Those are the four questions a guild
 * actually argues about while a trial is live, and all four are answerable from
 * the bar plus the rules — which is what this draws.
 *
 * The rules themselves, and every formula derived from them, are pinned in
 * `guild-trials-math.js`; reading the panel is `guild-trials-scrape.js`; the
 * samples and the building levels are `guild-trials-store.js`. This file is the
 * wiring: observe the tab, take a reading every few seconds while it is open,
 * and put three blocks on the screen.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot know
 *
 * **Rates are measured, not computed.** Nothing in the client's static data
 * gives a tier's required work or a trial boss's health, so the first reading of
 * a tier says "measuring" and the second gives a rate. That is also why samples
 * are persisted: a player who checks the tab twice a minute should not restart
 * the measurement each time.
 *
 * **Tier growth is exact, anchored on one observation.** Projecting the tier
 * after the current one needs the curve the totals grow along, which is not in
 * client data — but both kinds' curves are now known exactly (`exactTierTotal`:
 * a tenth of the first tier's work per skilling tier, `10 + level` for a combat
 * boss), and they are ratios, so the bar in hand anchors the whole ladder. The
 * fitted growth factor survives only as a fallback.
 *
 * **A skilling tier can be known from its bar alone.** The bar's target is
 * `base × (1 + 0.1 × (tier − 1)) × (1 + 0.01 × participants)`, and the base is
 * learned per skill the first time a stated tier, the target and the
 * participant count are on screen together — after which a mid-trial join on
 * the In Progress tab, which carries no tier at all, still knows which tier it
 * is watching (`tierFromWorkTarget`, `tierSource: 'work-ladder'`).
 *
 * **Tiers cleared is inferred from the tier on screen.** A trial starts at tier
 * 1 and climbs one at a time, so a trial showing tier 7 has banked six. This is
 * the only inference here that is not measured, and it is the one thing on the
 * block that nothing has ever confirmed — so the payout no longer rests on it:
 * the points come from what the cards state (below), which is checked against
 * the guild's own announcements. It still drives the "Banked N tiers" line and
 * where the pace projection starts from.
 *
 * **Token payouts are worth something, approximately.** Tokens have no market
 * price, but the guild shop trades them for guild credits and credits are priced
 * off the items that convert into them, so the payout rows carry a derived gold
 * figure labelled "via credit exchange" (`guild-token-value.js`). Without an
 * exchange rate the rows show the bare token count they always did.
 *
 * **Nothing arrives while the tab is shut.** This is the honest limit of the
 * whole feature and it is worth stating where somebody will read it: no socket
 * message carries a running trial's pool fill or a boss's health, so a reading
 * only exists because the tab was on screen when the sampler ran. A trial can
 * therefore be live, and this can have nothing to say about it, and both of
 * those can be true at once. Everything downstream — the blocks here, the
 * overlay tile in `guild-trials-row.js` — must say *that* rather than going
 * quiet, because a blank surface during a live trial is indistinguishable from a
 * broken one. It was reported as a broken one.
 *
 * **Zero is a claim, and usually the wrong one.** Three separate things used to
 * reach the screen as `0`: a tier that has not been seen because only the In
 * Progress tab was ever open (it carries no tier), a trial genuinely still on
 * its first tier, and a pace that could not be projected. The first is *unknown*
 * and the block now says which of the three it is, along with what to open to
 * fix it. A player who joins a trial midway sees the first of these until they
 * look at the Trials tab once, and it is not a failure of the arithmetic.
 *
 * **The game states what a trial has earned, and it wins.** The Trials tab's
 * cards carry an "840 pts" line, and four days of the guild's own chat
 * announcements say the sum of exactly those figures is the Guild Points the
 * guild is paid. So the payout block sums the cards. They are *Guild Points* —
 * base points with the Builder's Hall bonus already applied — which is the one
 * thing this file used to get wrong in both directions at once: it compared them
 * against the ladder's un-bonused figures and reported a disagreement on every
 * card of every week, and it looked each figure up under its own inference about
 * how many tiers were banked, missed by a tier every time, and fell back to the
 * ladder. Announced 2,880; panel said 2.4K.
 *
 * **A combat trial's DPS can be split per player.** The card's "Party DPS" is
 * measured off the boss bar and cannot say who is producing it. The fight itself
 * is an ordinary battle on the wire, so `guild-trial-damage.js` attributes it —
 * but only for fights this client is actually in, and only when the fight can be
 * shown to be the trial's.
 *
 * **Payout bonuses are 2% per level, both of them.** Guild Points scale with the
 * Builder's Hall and token payouts with the Treasury, and both in-game upgrade
 * popups confirm the same rule ("Guild Points: +20% → +22%" at Hall level 10,
 * "Guild Token Rewards: +10% → +12%" at Treasury level 5). The *levels* arrive
 * on guild traffic and are captured and persisted the moment they are seen. When
 * a level has not been seen the Builder's Hall bonus can still be recovered from
 * the cards themselves — a card states Guild Points for a tier whose base the
 * ladder knows, and the ratio is the bonus — and the Treasury, which has no such
 * shortcut, is left out of the token figures with the block saying so.
 *
 * **A combat card is health then mana.** Both bars belong to the boss, and only
 * the first is damage. The rate is accumulated across tier clears rather than
 * fitted to a falling bar, because a combat trial is a ladder of bosses and the
 * bar jumps *up* every time one dies — see `combatDamageRate`.

 *
 * - **crafting 40,000** — two guilds and an export: 49,920 = ×1.2×1.04 (T3,
 *   4 signed), 88,920 = ×1.9×1.17 (T10, 17 signed), and a full T2–T15 ladder
 *   41,600 × (1 + 0.1(t−1)) in the recorded week.
 * - **foraging 40,000** — a live trial watched through 40,800 / 44,880 /
 *   48,960 with 2 signed up.
 * - **alchemy 40,000** — a live card at 65,280 = ×1.6×1.02 (T7, 2 signed).
 * - **Trial Chameleon 550,000** — the pool bar's own ladder 550,000 / 600,000
 *   / 650,000 / 700,000 = (100 + 10t) × 5,000, with the HP bar exactly ×1.04
 *   beside it in a 4-participant guild and ×1.03 in a 3-participant one.
 * - **Trial Badger 330,000** — a `new_guild_battle` sheet: 429,000 with 30 in
 *   the trial, 330,000 × 1.3 exactly.
 *
 * Every observed skilling base has been 40,000, on every skill it has ever
 * been checked against, so all ten skilling trials are now seeded with it
 * rather than only the three that had been watched from the inside.
 *
 * That gap was not harmless. A base is *learned* only from a live progress bar
 * ({@link GuildTrials#_learnWorkBase}), and a bar only ever streams for a trial
 * this character joined — so an unjoined Milking or Tailoring card could never
 * learn one, and "learns on its first stated-tier moment" described a moment
 * that structurally never arrived. The work ladder was therefore unavailable
 * for exactly the cards with nothing else to go on. The learned store still
 * answers first and overrides these, so a skill that turns out to differ
 * corrects itself the moment somebody joins it.

    // That also settles the completed case the same way, which is what the
    // points identity already said: a finished card's badge is what it reached.
    //

    //    This is what makes a mid-trial join on the In Progress tab knowable

    // 17,353/99,840 — a target only T15 produces — while the panel said
    // "Banked 8 tiers" and "Next tier work (T10)". A `liveTier` of 9, stated
    // hours earlier when the trial genuinely was on tier 9, had been persisted
    // and never invalidated, and the rung order let it outrank the bar in
    // front of the player until a Trials-tab visit rewrote the badge.
    //
    // So staleness is now handled twice over:
    //
    // - A socket-stated tier is only believed **for the pool it was stated
    //   with**. The update carries `targetWorkValue`, the store keeps it as
    //   `liveTierTarget`, and the moment the bar's target no longer matches,
    //   the statement is about a tier that has since cleared and is dropped.
    // - Tiers only climb, so the winner is the **largest** valid rung — the
    //   badge and the socket can lag but never lead, and the work ladder reads
    //   the bar as it is *now*. Ties go to the stated sources over the derived
    //   one.
    //
    // The work ladder no longer needs the learned store to have spoken: any

 * ## One row set per phase
 *
 * The three states of a trial are not one layout with rows switched off. A card
 * whose trial has not started has one thing to say; a card whose trial is over
 * has results and no process; only a running trial wants the projections. Drawn
 * as a single set with per-row guards, the screen filled with variations of
 * nothing — a scheduled card stacked "scheduled — nothing running yet" over
 * "tier not seen yet" over "no trial fight seen here", and a finished one
 * offered to fit a growth curve for a next tier that will never be fought.
 *
 * So the phase picks the row set, and the participation rule composes with it:
 * a trial this character did not join, once it is over, shows the facts the
 * Trials tab states about it and no rows about data that can no longer arrive.
 *
 * @param {Object} [options] - Context
 * @param {boolean|null} [options.participating] - Whether this character is in this trial
 * @param {string|null} [options.phase] - `scheduled`, `live` or `completed`
 * @param {number|null} [options.startsInMs] - Countdown to the scheduled start
 * @param {Object|null} [options.forecast] - From `guild-trial-forecast.js`
 * @param {number|null} [options.deadlineMs] - Milliseconds of the trial's hour left, from
 *   the guild payload's own countdown rather than from a clock on the page
 * @returns {string} HTML

/**
 * Put a card's block somewhere it takes a row of its own.
 *
 * Third attempt, and the first two are why this is a function rather than a
 * style string. Appended *into* the card, it sat under the card's own footer,
 * because a card places its last rows against its bottom edge rather than after
 * whatever it contains. Inserted after the card with `grid-column: 1 / -1`, it
 * stayed one cell wide — 126px against a 525px section — and pushed into the
 * next section's heading. The devtools screenshots say why: the cards are grid
 * items, the section labels ("Combat Trial") are *flex* items of an outer box,
 * and `-1` resolves against the **explicit** grid, so on a container whose
 * columns are implicit `1 / -1` is a single cell.
 *
 * So the container is measured rather than assumed:
 *
 * - **A grid with a real column template.** Span every track it declares —
 *   `1 / span N` rather than `1 / -1`, because that works on implicit tracks too.
 * - **A grid with no template.** There is no row to span; the block goes after
 *   the whole grid, where it is a sibling of the next section label instead of
 *   a cell squeezed between cards.
 * - **A flex container.** `flex-basis: 100%` on a wrapping row is a line of its
 *   own; on a non-wrapping one it would squash the cards, so that goes after the
 *   container too.
 * - **Anything else** is ordinary flow, where a block-level div is already a row.
 *
 * When the block ends up away from its card it is given the trial's name, since
 * "Banked 3 tiers" under a stack of cards has to say which one.

     *
     * - Only a tier the game stated ('card', 'socket') teaches; the assumed and

     * - Only a *fresh* reading teaches. The record's last target survives tab
     *   switches, and a tier that cleared while the tab was shut would pair the
     *   old target with the new badge.
     * - A base already in hand that explains the current target at any whole
     *   tier is kept: relearning on a stale badge is how a constant drifts.

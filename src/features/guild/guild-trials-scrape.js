/**
 * Reading the guild trial tabs.
 *
 * ## There are two of them, and they hold different halves of the answer
 *
 * Confirmed from a live client, which is what this file spent its first two
 * revisions guessing at. The guild page's nav is Overview, Members,
 * Applications, **Trials**, **In Progress**, Buildings, Shop, Icons — and the
 * two trial tabs are not two views of one thing:
 *
 * - **Trials** is the setup tab. Its cards carry the trial's name and level
 *   ("Milking Lv.130"), what clearing it is worth ("600 pts"), how many members
 *   have signed up ("1/28 signed up"), and a countdown ("20m 53s"). There is no
 *   progress bar anywhere on it.
 * - **In Progress** is the live tab. Its card carries the reading everything
 *   here exists to measure — "Alchemy 18,850 / 65,280" — beside the members
 *   working on it, and a footer with the trial's own clock ("Time: 20m 37s").
 *   It carries no level and no tier.
 *
 * So neither tab is sufficient. The rate comes from In Progress, the tier and
 * the participant count come from Trials, and they are joined by the one thing
 * both cards carry: the trial's name. Sampling either tab writes into the same
 * record under the same key, and a card with nothing moving on it updates the
 * trial's identity without pushing a reading — see `recordTileSample`.
 *
 * The cost of getting this wrong was two revisions of a feature that recorded
 * nothing: the first required a container class the game does not use, and the
 * second required every card to carry a progress bar, which is true of exactly
 * one of the two tabs.
 *
 * The trial state a member can see is on the screen, and — as far as anything
 * this script can observe — only on the screen. The socket carries who signed up
 * (`guild_trial_signup_updated`, and `signedUpSkillingTrialHrid` /
 * `signedUpCombatTrialHrid` on every guild character) and when the week started
 * (`guild.currentWeekStartAt`), but nothing that has been seen carries a running
 * trial's pool fill or a trial boss's health. A participant's own client gets
 * `new_battle` and `battle_updated` for the fight they are in; everybody else in
 * the guild gets the panel. So the panel is what is read, and the socket is used
 * where it is authoritative.
 *
 * ## Why this parses shapes rather than class names
 *
 * The one class name this can lean on is `GuildPanel_tileSummary`, which is
 * already load-bearing elsewhere in the codebase (`guild-credit-value.js` tags
 * tier badges onto it) and carries the `Lv.<n>` the tier is derived from. The
 * rest of the tab's class names have not been verified against a live client, so
 * everything else is found by shape: a tile is whatever element holds a summary,
 * a progress reading is any `<n> / <n>` in the tile's text, and the two readings
 * on a combat card are told apart by which of them *moves which way* over time
 * rather than by which comes first in the markup.
 *
 * That caution turned out to be warranted and not cautious enough. The whole
 * feature was hung off one *unverified* container class — `GuildPanel_trialsContent`
 * — and if the game does not spell it that way, every reading, every projection
 * and the overlay tile that reads from them are all dark at once, silently,
 * with no error anywhere: the observer simply never fires and the interval's
 * `querySelector` simply never matches. Which is what was reported during a live
 * trial. So the container is now *found* rather than named ({@link findTrialsRoot}),
 * and a card is found by its contents rather than by its container.
 *
 * What keeps that from reading the rest of the guild page as trials is the one
 * part of a card that is not a number: `isTrialName` knows the five encounters
 * and the ten skills a trial can be run in, and a card whose name is not one of
 * them is not a trial — not a building, not a guild XP bar, not a member row.
 * That is a stronger filter than the level ladder it replaces, and unlike the
 * ladder it survives a card that carries no level at all, which is every card on
 * the In Progress tab.
 *
 * That last one matters: the observed combat card shows both a small falling
 * number over a large one (boss health) and a large rising number over a round
 * one. Assuming an order would silently invert every rate the moment the game
 * reflowed the card. Direction cannot be got wrong.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates the DOM — it only reads. The feature module does the
 * drawing.

 * clock reader would swallow whole — see the guards.
 *
 * What keeps it from reading a countdown out of something that is not one, which
 * matters because the root may be a whole guild panel:
 *
 * - **Per element, never the welded `textContent`.** Joining siblings invents
 *   digit runs that were never on screen, the same way it invents levels.
 * - **Nothing containing a `/`.** A trial's bar reads `582,115 / 600,000`, and
 *   `15 / 60` would otherwise parse as fifteen minutes.
 * - **No times of day.** The Trials tab's header reads "Skilling Trial - In
 *   Progress Thu 09:00 AM". As a colon clock that is nine minutes, it sits in a
 *   line saying "in progress", and it would have won — a confident, wrong
 *   deadline. A weekday or an am/pm anywhere in the line disqualifies it.
 * - **No decimals or percentages.** The In Progress footer reads "Work Time
 *   3.14s, Success Rate 60.8%". A countdown is never written with a decimal
 *   point, and "Work Time" is exactly the sort of line a label test would like.
 * - **Plausible as a trial clock or not at all.** A trial runs an hour, so
 *   anything above that or at zero is something else. Rejected rather than
 *   clamped: clamping an hour and a half down to an hour would turn a wrong
 *   reading into a confident one.
 *
 * Candidates are then ranked rather than taken first-come: a duration written in
 * units beats a colon clock, since only the latter is ambiguous with a time of
 * day, and a line that says what it is ("remaining", "Time:") beats a bare one.

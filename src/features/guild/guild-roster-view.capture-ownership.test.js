/** @vitest-environment happy-dom
 *
 * The Guild Roster's half of the loadout capture's reference count.
 *
 * `guildLoadoutCapture` is counted (`owners`) because two features start it and
 * neither owns it. The roster incremented that count in `initialize()` and
 * never gave it back in `cleanup()`, so across a character switch the count
 * only ever went up: the capture was never torn down, and `characterId`,
 * `guildName` and `record` — all resolved once, inside `initialize()` — stayed
 * pointed at the character that had left.
 *
 * The real `guild-loadout-capture.js` is used here on purpose. A mock of it
 * would prove only that a call was made; what is worth pinning down is that
 * the count reaches zero, that the module re-derives whose record it is
 * holding, and that a capture still owned by Guild Trials is *not* stopped.

/**
 * Putting names to the units in a spectated trial fight.
 *
 * `guild_battle_updated` — the stream that arrives while the In Progress fight
 * view is open — identifies its units by **index only**. `pMap` is `{"1": {…}}`
 * and nothing in the message says who "1" is. Every figure the per-player panel
 * draws is worthless attached to "Player 2", so this is the join, and it is
 * built out of three sources of decreasing trust.
 *
 * ## 1. The fight view's own portraits
 *
 * The trial fight view draws the same `CombatUnit` tiles the ordinary battle
 * panel does, names and all, in slot order. When the tiles cover the index being
 * asked about, their order *is* the slot order and the name is read straight
 * off. This is a fact on screen rather than an inference, so it wins.
 *
 * It is also the source that is not always there: the view has to be open, and
 * the class names carry a build hash, so the selector is a prefix match and the
 * resolver simply falls through when the game renames them.
 *
 * ## 2. The captured build's vitals
 *
 * A tick states `mHP` and `mMP` — the unit's *maximum* health and mana, which do
 * not move during a fight — and `guild-loadout-capture.js` has been recording
 * exactly those two numbers per guild member for weeks. In the capture that
 * proved this stream exists, `pMap["1"]` read `mHP: 2612, mMP: 2180` and exactly
 * one member's sheet said `Max HP 2,612, Max MP 2,180`. That is an identification.
 *
 * The pair is used rather than health alone because health alone collides: two
 * members in the same gear have the same health and the same mana, and a match
 * that fits two people identifies neither. **An ambiguous signature resolves to
 * nobody**, which is the whole discipline of this file — a wrong name on a
 * damage row is worse than no name, because a guild acts on it.
 *
 * ## 3. Nothing
 *
 * `Player 2`, and the caller says the name is a placeholder. Never a guess from
 * whoever happens to be online, or the roster in alphabetical order.
 *
 * ## 0. The roster, once one arrives
 *
 * That better source turned up, exactly where this predicted: **`new_guild_battle`**
 * fires at every tier and carries `players[]` in slot order with
 * `character.id` and `character.name` on each entry, and a tick's `pMap` keys
 * are indexes into that array — entry 19 is Player20, verified against a raw
 * recording. So the roster now sits at the top of the list and the three sources
 * below it are what a viewer who joined mid-tier still has.
 *
 * It slotted in as an argument rather than a rewrite, which is what the list
 * shape was for.
 *
 * ## The portraits are not slot-ordered in the spectate view, and that mislabelled damage
 *
 * Reported live, after a page refresh dropped the roster: the leaderboard
 * showed the watcher's own name **twice** — "MillenniumTest 161/s" and
 * "MillenniumTest 113/s" — while a real member vanished from it entirely. The
 * spectate fight view draws only the *watcher's own* unit as a full
 * `CombatUnit`; the rest of the party are `MiniUnit` lines. So the portrait
 * list was one name long — the watcher's — and reading it positionally handed
 * that name to whichever slot happened to be index 0, while the watcher's real
 * slot earned the same name from their own captured build. Two rules close it:
 *
 * - **Positional portraits only when they cover the party.** A portrait list
 *   shorter than the party is not in slot order for anybody.
 * - **One name, one unit.** The watcher's own name may only bind to the slot
 *   their own attack counters confirm, and any resolution pass ends by
 *   enforcing injectivity outright — a duplicate name demotes the weaker claim
 *   to a placeholder rather than letting two rows wear it.
 *
 * The mini-unit names still earn their keep as a *set*: they say who is in the
 * party without saying where, and when exactly one unit is unnamed and exactly
 * one on-screen name unclaimed, the pairing is forced rather than guessed.

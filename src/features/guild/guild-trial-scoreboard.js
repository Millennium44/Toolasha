/**
 * Who is carrying the trial, as a panel rather than four lines under a card.
 *
 * The per-player split already exists (`guild-trial-damage.js`) and is drawn as
 * a short list under the combat trial's card. That is the right size for a
 * glance and the wrong size for the question a guild actually argues about after
 * a tier fails, which wants ranks, shares, bars, and the healing beside the
 * damage. So the same numbers get a panel.
 *
 * ## Two tabs, three sources, and every figure says which one it is
 *
 * A trial fight is real and server-run, and opening the In Progress **fight
 * view** streams it here as `guild_battle_updated` — so these tabs can be
 * measured after all, for the stretch somebody was watching. Three things can
 * therefore be on screen, and they are never mixed:
 *
 * 1. **Measured** — folded from spectated ticks. Preferred whenever it exists.
 * 2. **Estimated** — each member's captured build worth per second, shared out.
 *    The fallback when nothing has been watched, labelled at the top rather than
 *    footnoted. Members with no captured build are named, not dropped.
 * 3. **Nothing** — with a reason that says what to do about it, which is now
 *    "open the fight view" rather than an apology.
 *
 * **Healing** has no estimate to fall back on: a build says nothing about how
 * much healing a fight will call for. Watched, it fills from the same ticks the
 * damage does — health rising, attributed to a lone healer on the tick and kept
 * unattributed otherwise (`guild-trial-support.js`).
 *
 * The party-wide rate on the trial card stays where it is and stays measured;
 * this panel never competes with it.
 *
 * ## Colour
 *
 * By damage type, from the loadouts already captured off `battle_unit_fetched`
 * (`combatStats.damageType`, or the combat style when the type is absent) —
 * which is a fact about the player rather than a guess from their name. A player
 * whose loadout has never been seen gets the neutral accent, because a colour
 * that means "unknown" and a colour that means "physical" must not be the same
 * colour.

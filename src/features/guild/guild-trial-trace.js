/**
 * Raw diagnostic trace of a guild trial's websocket stream.
 *
 * The trials feature analyses a trial through summaries — tallies, snapshots,
 * comparisons — and every one of them is a derivation. When a derived figure is
 * disputed, the only thing that settles it is the stream the derivation was made
 * from, and nothing keeps that today. This does: every trial battle message,
 * exactly as received and in order, timestamped so a reader can reconstruct the
 * timeline offline.
 *
 * Opt-in (`guildTrialDiagnosticTrace`, default off), because the file is large
 * and carries raw combat data with participant names in it.
 *
 * Persisted, not memory-only: a full-hour 50-player fight is ~36,000 ticks at
 * the observed ~10/s cadence, each tick 2–4KB of JSON — holding that as parsed
 * objects in a tab that must also render the fight is what used to make the
 * trace the thing that killed the evidence. Events are kept as pre-stringified
 * NDJSON lines, flushed to IndexedDB in gzipped chunks, and re-adopted on
 * reload, so a mid-fight refresh loses at most one flush interval instead of
 * the whole trace. Keys are character-scoped — two characters in two tabs each
 * keep their own trace.
 *
 * The websocket hook deliberately exempts `new_guild_battle` and
 * `guild_battle_updated` from its content-hash dedup (consecutive ticks open
 * with identical text), so the trace drops adjacent byte-identical
 * `guild_battle_updated` payloads itself and counts them — a trace that silently
 * kept doubles would read as twice the cadence it really had.

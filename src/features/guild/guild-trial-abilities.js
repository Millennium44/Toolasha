/**
 * Who has shown their kit this trial, and which auras the party actually has.
 *
 * A guild trial runs for an hour with up to fifty participants, and the only
 * source of a member's equipped abilities is their Battle Info popup —
 * captured one click at a time through `guild-loadout-capture.js`. This module
 * keeps the *session*: which participants have produced an authoritative kit
 * this hour, which are still owed a click, and what that means for the party's
 * aura coverage.
 *
 * ## The session and when it resets
 *
 * There is no server trial-session id, so a session is the guild plus an
 * observed start, the same way `guild-trial-recorder.js` models one. The rule
 * is deliberately blunt: a session resets only when
 *
 * - a capture or a live tick arrives more than {@link SESSION_MAX_AGE_MS}
 *   after the session was *last active* (its last tick or capture) — the
 *   trial has been silent for longer than any trial is, so this is the next
 *   one. Measured from the last activity and not from the start, because a
 *   trial is a skilling hour and a combat hour back to back: a session that
 *   began at the skilling whistle is two hours old and still this trial's,
 *   and a clock run from its start wiped the combat roster five minutes in;
 * - {@link GuildTrialAbilities#noteTrialStart} is called for a session older
 *   than {@link TRIAL_START_GRACE_MS} that has also been quiet that long —
 *   the explicit signal, debounced so the two auto-start signals arriving
 *   together cannot wipe a capture in progress, and ignored while the ticks
 *   say the trial it would wipe is still running (skilling hour into combat
 *   hour is one trial, not two);
 * - {@link GuildTrialAbilities#recapture} is called — the button;
 * - the guild changes ({@link GuildTrialAbilities#setGuildName}) — another
 *   guild's captures say nothing about this one's trial.
 *
 * Nothing else resets it. Slot order, tier and wave all change *during* a
 * trial, and a captured player stays captured through every one of them.
 *
 * ## What counts as captured
 *
 * Only a snapshot whose payload itself carried a `combatAbilities` array
 * (`abilitiesAuthoritative === true`, empty array included — an authoritative
 * empty kit is a genuinely empty kit). A stat-only sighting proves the player
 * exists and says nothing about their abilities, so it leaves them outstanding:
 * "abilities unavailable" is a different claim from "no abilities equipped",
 * and coverage must not treat the first as the second.
 *
 * Socket-free on purpose: the roster and the tier are fed in by the caller,
 * captures are fed in as snapshots, and everything downstream of them is pure
 * and testable without a connection.

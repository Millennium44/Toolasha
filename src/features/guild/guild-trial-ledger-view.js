/**
 * The ledger and the planner, drawn.
 *
 * Two questions a guild leader asks that no surface in the game answers, in one
 * panel because they are the same conversation held at two ends of a week: who
 * turned up and what they did (`guild-trial-ledger.js`), and whether the list
 * about to sign up can actually clear the tier (`guild-trial-composition.js`).
 *
 * Everything below is drawing. The arithmetic, the lint rules and the storage
 * all live in those two modules and are tested without a DOM; what is here is
 * the sortable table, the window selector, the coverage line, the CSV button and
 * the paste box — plus the one piece of state a redraw must not lose, which is
 * whatever the user has half-typed into the roster box.
 *
 * ## Why a panel and not a tab on the guild page
 *
 * `guild-trials.js` decorates the game's own trial cards, and those cards are
 * only on screen while the guild page is open on the right tab. The ledger is
 * read *between* trials — on a Sunday, deciding who to message — so it is a
 * floating panel and an overlay row, reachable whatever the page is showing.

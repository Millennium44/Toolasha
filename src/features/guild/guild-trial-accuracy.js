/**
 * How close the tick-by-tick attribution actually got, per trial.
 *
 * `guild-trial-damage.js` measures a guild trial by watching the spectator
 * stream go past and splitting each tick between the players it names. At the
 * end of the fight the game sends its own per-member totals
 * (`guild_trial_stats_updated`), and those two figures are the only pair in the
 * whole feature where a measurement can be checked against an authority. That
 * check used to go one place — the export builder — where nobody reads it.
 *
 * This module is the arithmetic of that check, kept away from both the measuring
 * and the drawing so it can be tested without either.
 *
 * ## Why the three metrics are reported apart
 *
 * Damage is the one the stream is built to attribute: a tick carries an
 * `atkCounter` per player and the split follows it. Healing and damage taken
 * are inferred from health deltas — a heal landing on the same tick as a hit
 * nets out, an over-heal is invisible, and mitigation happens server-side — so
 * they run wider by construction. Averaging the three into one "accuracy" would
 * bury an actually-broken damage split under two figures that are *expected* to
 * be loose. They are summarized separately and the expectation is stated in the
 * UI, so a reader is not invited to file normal imperfection as a bug.
 *
 * ## The join is by name, and says so when a name does not join
 *
 * Neither side of the pair carries a character id by the time it gets here: the
 * game's stats arrive per character id and are resolved to names before storage,
 * the measurement is keyed by the display name the stream spelled. A player who
 * renamed mid-week — or whose name the stream never resolved — appears on one
 * side and not the other. Counting that as a 100% miss would libel the
 * measurement; counting it as 0% would flatter it. It is counted as
 * **unmatched** and shown as a count, and it is kept out of every median.

/**
 * Who is doing the damage in a guild combat trial.
 *
 * The trial card already says what the party is doing — "Party DPS 521 dmg/s,
 * kill in 17m" — measured off the boss bar on the In Progress tab. That figure
 * is the sum of five people and it cannot say which of them is carrying it,
 * which is the question a guild actually asks after a trial fails a tier.
 *
 * From the websocket's point of view a trial fight is an ordinary battle:
 * `new_battle` names the party and the boss, `battle_updated` ticks several
 * times a second, and neither carries a word about who struck. So this reuses
 * the attribution the combat features already run on
 * (`utils/damage-attribution.js` — the attack counter identifies the attacker, a
 * hit is `dmgCounter` rising, a bleed is not a hit) rather than inventing a
 * second answer that would disagree with the DPS panel.
 *
 * ## What counts, and how a trial fight is told from any other
 *
 * This is the whole risk of the feature. Attributing every battle would credit
 * an evening of Chimerical grinding to the trial and report a party DPS the
 * guild never produced, so the gate is deliberately narrow and it fails closed:
 *
 * 1. **A monster that says it is a trial.** Any monster name containing "trial"
 *    arms the tally on its own. Nothing else on the wire spells that word.
 * 2. **This week's encounter, by name.** The guild trials record knows the
 *    week's combat trial card ("Trial Chameleon"), and the five encounters are a
 *    closed list (`COMBAT_ENCOUNTERS`). A battle whose monster reduces to the
 *    same encounter as the card is that trial.
 *    Without a combat card on the record — no trial this week, or the panel has
 *    never been opened — rule 2 cannot fire at all, which is the conservative
 *    direction.
 * 3. **Nothing else.** A battle that matches neither is not attributed, and the
 *    breakdown says so rather than showing an empty table that reads as zero
 *    damage.
 *
 * Re-decided on every `new_battle`, because each tier of a trial is its own
 * fight and so is the zone the player returns to afterwards. A `battle_updated`
 * carrying a battle id this module never saw announced disarms the tally until
 * the next `new_battle` confirms what is being fought — a reload mid-trial
 * therefore measures nothing rather than measuring the wrong thing.
 *
 * This gate has never once armed, and it is not supposed to: a trial fight is
 * not on this client's own battle feed. That is why it is no longer the only
 * source.
 *
 * ## The spectator stream, which is the real one
 *
 * Opening the In Progress **fight view** subscribes the client to
 * `guild_battle_updated`, and it is a firehose: 127 messages in a minute of
 * watching, each one
 *
 * ```
 * {type, battleId, tier, pMap, mMap}
 * ```
 *
 * with `pMap`/`mMap` entries in exactly the shape a normal battle tick uses —
 * `cHP mHP cMP mMP isActive leftCombat atkCounter isAutoAtk abilityHrid int
 * dmgCounter critCounter`. `mMap["0"]` is the boss, its `cHP` is the pool bar to
 * the unit (454,807 of 618,000 in the capture, which is the T2 Chameleon pool
 * exactly), and `tier` states outright what the DOM badge had to be reasoned
 * about. So the fight *is* real and server-run, and spectating streams it.
 *
 * Everything below therefore runs twice over: the same `attributeTick`,
 * `foldEvents` and `foldSupportTick` this module already used, fed from a second
 * listener. Nothing about the arithmetic changes, because the payload shape does
 * not.
 *
 * ### What that costs, and what it does not
 *
 * - **Only after somebody watches.** Opening the fight view is what starts the
 *   stream — and, observed live, the stream then keeps flowing while other game
 *   tabs are browsed rather than stopping the moment the view closes. Every
 *   tick that arrives is counted: the measurement is the stream as received,
 *   gaps and all, and the recorder's session gaps model the gaps.
 * - **Units are indexes.** `pMap` is `{"1": …}` with no roster on it, so names
 *   come from `guild-trial-units.js` — the fight view's own portraits first, the
 *   captured builds' maximum health and mana second, and a placeholder when
 *   neither can say. A wrong name is worse than no name.
 * - **A per-player damage split needs the players' own counters.** Boss health
 *   falling is party damage and is unambiguous; splitting it needs `atkCounter`
 *   on the `pMap` entries, which the attribution module requires and refuses to
 *   guess without. Ticks that carried them are counted, so the panel can say
 *   which of the two it has rather than drawing an empty table.
 *
 * ### What is shown when nothing has been watched
 *
 * {@link estimateDamageSplit} — a per-player split derived from the members'
 * captured builds, labelled as an estimate. Measured beats estimated whenever
 * measured exists, and the panels name the source either way.
 *
 * ## Where the lifecycle rules came from
 *
 * The trial-end handling — freezing the elapsed denominator when the trial ends,
 * treating a stream quiet for three minutes as ended anyway, and leaving
 * everything alone while the game's own per-member totals are still in flight —
 * is KikiMeter v3.32.1's by ZhuLiMoon (MIT), which found each of them the hard
 * way on live trials. See `third-party/kikimeter/` and
 * `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is Toolasha's own.

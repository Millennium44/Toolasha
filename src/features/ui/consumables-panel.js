/**
 * Consumables panel
 *
 * Everything the character is eating and drinking — and, in a dungeon, the
 * entry keys the runs are spending — how long it lasts, and what it would take
 * to keep it going.
 *
 * The overlay row answers "what runs out first, and when". That is the figure
 * worth watching, but it is not the figure worth acting on — when the answer is
 * "six hours", the next question is immediately "so what do I buy, and how
 * much", and the row cannot hold that. This can.
 *
 * ## The target duration is the point
 *
 * Every line is measured against a duration you pick: overnight, a day, a
 * weekend. A list of stock levels tells you what you have; the same list against
 * "last me a day" tells you what to do about it, and the two readings differ for
 * every consumable because they are consumed at different rates.
 *
 * Shortfalls are rounded up and counted from what is already held, so the figure
 * is what to buy rather than what to own. The arithmetic is in
 * `utils/consumable-forecast.js`; this module lists, sorts and draws.
 *
 * Party members are shown when there are any, because a party run stops when the
 * **first** member runs dry, and that member is frequently not you.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in the UI bundle
 *
 * It reads combat data but is otherwise a panel, and the combat bundle is close
 * to its size ceiling while this one is not. The collector it reads is a
 * stateful singleton fed by the websocket, so it is declared shared in
 * `rollup.config.js` rather than imported into a second copy that would sit
 * there receiving nothing.

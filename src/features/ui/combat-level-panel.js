/**
 * Combat Level panel
 *
 * How close the next combat level is, which skill gets you there, and what the
 * session has actually earned.
 *
 * The game shows a whole number. That hides both facts worth acting on: combat
 * level is a weighted average, so the fraction you have already earned is
 * invisible, and the skill that would finish it soonest is usually not the one
 * being trained.
 *
 * ## The bar is not the fraction of the formula
 *
 * The obvious reading of "how far to the next combat level" is the fraction the
 * displayed whole number throws away — `126.300` is 30% of the way to 127. That
 * is wrong, and wrong in a way that matters. Combat level is computed from whole
 * skill levels, so it steps; feed it the part-finished levels instead and it
 * becomes continuous. A build at `126.300` whose Melee is 81.7% of the way to
 * its next level is **79%** of the way to Combat 127, not 30% — because most of
 * the Melee level carrying the doubled term is already in the bank.
 *
 * So the panel runs the formula twice. Whole levels give the number the game
 * shows and the arithmetic spelled out beside it; fractional levels give the
 * bar. The bar is drawn in two colours for the same reason: the part banked from
 * completed levels, then the part contributed by the level in progress.
 *
 * ## What is on it
 *
 * - the session: when it started, how long, how much experience, at what rate
 * - a target selector: any skill, any level, the time to get there
 * - the combat level, the formula, and the two-tone bar above
 * - a block per skill actually gaining, with its share of the experience
 * - Time to Level, where reassigning the primary and focus skills answers "what
 *   if I trained something else instead" without training it
 * - the skills not gaining, compactly, and the charms and wisdom multiplying it
 * - experience between any two levels
 *
 * The arithmetic is in `utils/combat-level.js` and `utils/exp-session.js`,
 * checked against the figures GWhiz shows for the same build — `126.300`, the
 * 79% bar, "2 Levels of Melee", and the 8d 22h behind it are all reproduced.
 *
 * The panel is GWhiz's, from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

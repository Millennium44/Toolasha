/**
 * Overlay tab button
 *
 * A switch for the overlay, in the strip where the other panels live.
 *
 * The overlay is opened from the settings dialog, which is the wrong place for
 * something toggled several times an hour: it is a readout you want up while
 * fighting and out of the way while reading a recipe, and a two-click trip
 * through a dialog is enough friction that people leave it up and work around
 * it instead.
 *
 * So it gets a switch beside Equipment, Abilities and the rest — the strip you
 * are already using to change what that column shows. It is drawn as Room Logs
 * and Bulk Sell are: a clone of a real tab so it inherits whatever the game
 * currently thinks a tab looks like, with a glyph saying it opens a panel and
 * dimming saying whether that panel is up. A button that lights a panel when
 * clicked and then does nothing visible when clicked again reads as broken.
 *
 * It sits before Optimizer, which is also injected — and injected later than
 * this on a slow load, so its position is re-checked rather than set once.
 *
 * ## Why there is a second one on a phone
 *
 * That strip is the character column's, and on a desktop the character column is
 * always on screen — whatever else you are doing, the tabs are there and so is
 * this switch. On a phone the game shows one panel at a time, so the column and
 * its tab strip are simply not in the document while you are looking at the
 * marketplace, the map, or a fight. The switch is injected into a strip that does
 * not exist, which is why the overlay could only be opened from the inventory
 * screen: not a bug in the button, but the button having nowhere to be.
 *
 * So in mobile mode there is also a launcher — a small round button fixed to the
 * window rather than to any of the game's own furniture, which is the only thing
 * that survives the game swapping its whole screen out. It can be dragged, and
 * where it is dragged to is remembered, because a fixed spot that happens to sit
 * on top of a control on one phone is a launcher that has to be worked around
 * forever. Desktop is untouched: no mobile mode, no launcher.
 *
 * ## Dragging it away
 *
 * A launcher that can be moved out of the way can also be moved out of the way
 * *permanently* — some players simply do not want a floating button on screen.
 * Rather than add a separate settings toggle nobody finds until they go looking,
 * dragging it far enough is itself the toggle: a "drop here to hide" zone shows
 * up near the bottom of the screen for the length of the drag, and releasing the
 * launcher over it hides the launcher instead of just moving it. This does not
 * touch how a drag *starts* — it still begins the moment a finger goes down
 * (`touchAction: 'none'`), because gating that behind a long press would make
 * every ordinary reposition slower, which is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * The hidden flag is stored device-local (`toolasha_local_` prefix, see
 * `DEVICE_LOCAL_KEY_PREFIXES` in `core/settings-storage.js`) rather than as a
 * synced setting: hiding the launcher is a statement about *this* screen, and a
 * phone and a desktop fighting over one synced flag would mean dismissing it on
 * the phone also takes it off a desktop that never had the problem this solves.
 * A settings-panel control (elsewhere) flips the flag back — see
 * `isLauncherHidden`/`setLauncherHidden` below for what it calls.

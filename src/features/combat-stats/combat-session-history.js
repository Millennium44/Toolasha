/**
 * Combat session history
 *
 * The runs before this one, so the loot panel can be asked about them.
 *
 * The collector keeps exactly one snapshot — the run in progress — which is
 * everything the overlay needs and nothing the question "what did last night
 * actually earn" needs. FLoot answers that from a session list, and this is the
 * list.
 *
 * ## What counts as a session
 *
 * The same thing the damage tally counts: the roster and the server's
 * `combatStartTime` together. Either half alone is not enough — the same party
 * in a new zone is a new run, and the same zone with somebody gone is a
 * different run measuring different people.
 *
 * ## Archived on the way out, not on the way in
 *
 * A session is written to history when a *different* one starts, because that is
 * the first moment it is known to be over — nothing in the payload says "this
 * run has ended", and a timer would guess. The consequence is that the newest
 * finished run appears the moment the next one begins, and a run still under way
 * is never in the list. It does not need to be: it is the live session.
 *
 * The snapshot stored is the last one seen of that session, which is its final
 * state, since the loot totals only ever grow.
 *
 * That holds for one observer. Two devices can each hold a different stretch of
 * the same run under the same key, and neither snapshot is the whole of it, so
 * two copies of one session are combined field by field rather than one winning
 * whole — see `mergeSessionRecords`.

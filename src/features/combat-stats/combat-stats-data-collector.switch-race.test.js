/**
 * A character switch tearing the collector down while its initialize() is
 * parked on one of its two storage reads.
 *
 * `isInitialized` is set *before* both reads, so the switch's own re-initialise
 * never early-returned — the interrupted call simply resumed after `cleanup()`
 * had unhooked `new_battle` and `battle_consumable_ability_updated` and nulled
 * the fields holding them, and re-stored its own handles into those same
 * fields. The previous pair stayed live with nothing left to remove it by, and
 * every tick after that was counted once per leaked pair: doubled damage and
 * doubled consumable counts in the Combat Statistics panel, tripled after two
 * switches, and so on for as long as the tab lived.

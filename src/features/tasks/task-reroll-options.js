/**
 * What a task card's reroll chooser is offering, and what it costs.
 *
 * Pressing a task's Reroll button swaps its action row for a chooser. Every
 * feature that has anything to say about a reroll — the bulk reroller pressing
 * one, protection cancelling one, the header button pricing the next one — has
 * to answer the same question first: which of the buttons on this card is a
 * reroll, and is it free, coins or cowbells?
 *
 * Toolasha used to answer it by reading the label: a reroll option was a button
 * whose text began with "Pay". Nothing in the game guarantees that, and the
 * screenshots of the chooser that finally arrived show it does not hold — the
 * paid options are an icon and a number, and the free one is
 * "MooPass Free Reroll" with no count at all. Under that reading the chooser
 * offers exactly one recognisable button, the free one, and the moment the free
 * one is unavailable (or has been demoted for going nowhere) the bulk reroller
 * finds nothing to press, returns false, and does nothing at all — for the rest
 * of the session, while its label keeps promising a 10.0K reroll.
 *
 * So the chooser is read structurally instead: everything that is not one of the
 * card's own controls (Back, Go, Reroll, Claim, Confirm Discard, the icon-only
 * trash can) and not Toolasha's own injected furniture is a reroll option, and
 * its currency comes from the icon it carries, falling back to the size of the
 * number in its label. That recognises "Pay 10K", "10,000" and a bare icon
 * button alike, and it keeps recognising them when the next build renames
 * everything.

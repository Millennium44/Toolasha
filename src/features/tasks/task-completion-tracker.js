/**
 * What the task board has actually paid out.
 *
 * Nothing in this script recorded a finished task. The reroll tracker records
 * what a task cost to look at, the statistics panel reads the board as it stands
 * this second, and both of them forget a task the moment it leaves the board —
 * which is the moment it is worth remembering, because that is when it pays. So
 * the Task Tokens tile could say what the board *will* be worth and could not
 * say what an hour of tasks *is* worth. This is the missing half.
 *
 * ## What counts as a completion
 *
 * A task leaves the board three ways, and only one of them is income:
 *
 * - **Claimed.** The server sends the quest back with
 *   `/quest_status/claimed`, and `data-manager` drops claimed quests from
 *   `characterQuests` on the strength of exactly that field — so it is the one
 *   signal here with a second witness in the codebase. That is a completion.
 * - **Discarded.** The trash can. The quest leaves in_progress without ever
 *   being claimed, and pays nothing.
 * - **Rerolled.** The quest *keeps its id* and gets a new monster or action, a
 *   new goal and new rewards, with `coinRerollCount`/`cowbellRerollCount` one
 *   higher. It never leaves in_progress, so a tracker watching only for
 *   disappearance would count the reroll as a completion and then count the
 *   real completion again later.
 *
 * Only the claim is recorded. Nothing is inferred from a quest that merely
 * vanishes: a claim always arrives as a message while the script is listening,
 * and the live map is memory-only, so a quest that disappears across a reload
 * has no snapshot to be inferred from anyway. Inference would buy nothing and
 * would risk booking a trashed task as income.
 *
 * ## Why the rates are wall-clock
 *
 * A completion carries no duration. The time a task took is the time between
 * getting it and turning it in, which includes every hour the tab was shut, and
 * nothing cheap distinguishes those from the hours spent working on it — the
 * only per-task duration in the codebase comes out of `calculateTaskProfit`,
 * which is a market pass per task. So the rate is measured between the first and
 * last completion in the window and is labelled as wall-clock wherever it is
 * shown. The clock starts at the first completion, so its rewards are not
 * counted: n completions span n-1 intervals, and dividing all n by that span is
 * how a fresh pair of tasks reads as double the rate it really is.

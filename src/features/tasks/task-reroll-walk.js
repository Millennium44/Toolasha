/**
 * Guided task reroll walk.
 *
 * Working a full task board down to something worth doing is a lot of clicking:
 * open a card's chooser, pay, look at what arrived, decide, pay again, and on
 * to the next card. This walks that for you — but it walks it, it does not run
 * it.
 *
 * **One user click is one game action, always.** Pressing the walk's button
 * performs exactly one click on exactly one of the game's own buttons and then
 * stops and tells you what the next press would do. Nothing is chained, nothing
 * is queued, nothing fires on a timer or off a websocket message: opening a
 * card's chooser is one press, closing it is another. The only work this module
 * does between presses is reading the board and writing a label.
 *
 * The presses that spend — a reroll payment, the free reroll, a discard
 * confirm — the game accepts only from the player's own hand (it checks
 * `event.isTrusted`, which no script can fake). Those steps are therefore
 * *asked for* rather than made: the walk highlights the exact button, the chip
 * points at it, and a capture listener does the bookkeeping when the player's
 * real press lands.
 *
 * The rules come from what the player has already configured elsewhere:
 *
 *  - the reroll-protection list (the shield popup) — a protected task is left
 *    exactly where it is, and the walk moves past it;
 *  - that same popup's "Block rerolls at &lt;coins&gt; &lt;cowbells&gt;"
 *    thresholds — the walk stops rerolling a task the moment its *next* reroll
 *    would cost that much or more. There is no second reroll budget to keep in
 *    step with it: a walk that gave up after three rerolls while the shield
 *    popup was still happy to pay, or the reverse, was two rules for one
 *    decision and the player had to hold both;
 *  - `tasks_rerollWalkCurrency` — which of the two currencies to spend, when
 *    both are still under their threshold;
 *  - `tasks_rerollWalkTrashAtLimit` — what to do with a task whose reroll
 *    options are both blocked: offer the trash can, or move past it.
 *
 * ## What the next reroll costs
 *
 * The game doubles a task's reroll price each time it is used, per currency and
 * per task: 10K → 20K → 40K → 80K → 160K → 320K coins, and 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 →
 * 32 cowbells, each capped at the last step. That formula is what prices a card
 * whose chooser is shut. When the chooser is open its own Pay buttons are the
 * source of truth instead — they are what the click will actually spend, and a
 * build that changes the progression changes them first.
 *
 * The two prices are then compared in the one unit that makes them comparable:
 * coins. A cowbell is valued the way the task profit display values it (through
 * the Bag of 10 Cowbells on the market), so "2🔔" and "20K🪙" can be put side by
 * side and the cheaper one picked — and the label says which and why, because a
 * walk quietly spending cowbells is a walk you find out about later.
 *
 * ## What it has spent
 *
 * The walk keeps a running total of the coins and cowbells it has paid, priced
 * from the chooser button each payment actually pressed, and says it on the
 * label and in the finished summary. It is a readout and nothing more: no
 * budget, no governor, no second stopping rule — that decision is settled
 * above and stays settled. The total exists because the alternative was
 * reconstructing it from your coin balance afterwards.
 *
 * Before every click the board is re-read and compared against what was
 * planned. If the card in that slot is not the card the label is about — the
 * game re-ordered the board, a task completed, a reroll landed differently than
 * expected — the walk clicks nothing and plans again from what is actually
 * there, so a board the combat ticks redraw constantly never turns one walk
 * into a string of restarts.

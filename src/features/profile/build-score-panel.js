/**
 * Build Score panel
 *
 * What your build score is made of.
 *
 * The overlay's Build Score tile prints one figure and, until now, was the only
 * tile with nothing behind it — double-clicking it did nothing, because the only
 * detailed view that existed was the game's own profile modal, which you cannot
 * open on yourself without going and finding yourself in a chat line.
 *
 * ## What the number is
 *
 * A score is a **price**: the coin cost of the build, divided by a million. A
 * score of 340 means the kit, the ability books, the house levels and the shrine
 * levels would cost about 340 million coins to buy today. That convention is
 * stated at the top of the panel, because a bare "340" is otherwise a magic
 * number that people assume is a rating out of something.
 *
 * ## Where the lines come from
 *
 * All of it out of `calculateCombatScore`. Nothing here re-prices anything: the
 * calculator already produces a row per house room, per equipped ability, per
 * worn item and per guild shrine, each with the coins it cost, and this panel
 * arranges them. Where the calculator does not know something — a house room's
 * hrid, so no icon; a guild token's gold value, so no price — the panel says so
 * rather than inventing it.
 *
 * ## Own character only
 *
 * The score of somebody else's build is on their profile card, and it is not the
 * same score: shrine levels are only ever known for your own character. So this
 * panel reads the current character and nothing else, and the link that opens it
 * from the profile popup appears only when the profile is yours.
 *
 * ## Why the score arrives from outside
 *
 * The figure is owned by the overlay row, which recomputes it on equipment and
 * house changes rather than on a timer — pricing a +13 means simulating what it
 * cost to get there. The row hands the panel a reader rather than the panel
 * importing the row, so the imports run one way: row → panel.

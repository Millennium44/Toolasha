/**
 * Build Score overlay row
 *
 * Your own combat score, without opening your own profile.
 *
 * Toolasha already computes this — it is the figure on the profile card, the
 * coin cost of the build split into house, abilities and equipment. It is only
 * ever shown for a profile you have opened, which means the one profile you
 * cannot casually see it for is your own.
 *
 * ## Assembling a profile for yourself
 *
 * `calculateCombatScore` takes a `profile_shared` payload, and reads exactly
 * three things out of it: the house rooms, the equipped abilities, and the worn
 * items. All three are already known for the current character, so rather than
 * waiting for the game to share your profile with you, the same shape is built
 * from what the client already holds. The same function then gives the same
 * answer as the card.
 *
 * ## When it recalculates
 *
 * Not on the overlay's timer. Scoring a build prices every worn item, and prices
 * a +13 by simulating what it cost to get there — a worker-pool job, not
 * something to repeat once a second for a figure that changes when you change
 * gear. So it recomputes on equipment and house changes, debounced, and holds
 * the last answer in between.
 *
 * It also starts working only once something asks: the listeners are attached by
 * the first render, so a row nobody has switched on costs nothing at all.

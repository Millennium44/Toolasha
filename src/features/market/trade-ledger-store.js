/**
 * Trade Ledger Store Module
 *
 * Records every observed fill on your own market listings — one record per
 * fill event, partial fills included — by diffing successive listing states
 * from `market_listings_updated`. Where `trade-history.js` keeps only the last
 * buy/sell price per item, this keeps the whole history, which is what realized
 * flip profit needs.
 *
 * The diffing itself (what counts as a fill, what a baseline is, how the state
 * map stays bounded) lives in `src/utils/trade-ledger.js`; this module owns the
 * wiring: WebSocket events in, per-character IndexedDB persistence out.
 *
 * ## How the fills are stored
 *
 * One record per UTC day, keyed `tradeLedgerRec_<charId>_<YYYY-MM-DD>`, rather
 * than one array per character. The single array was read back, merged and
 * rewritten in full — up to `LEDGER_RECORD_CAP` records — immediately on every
 * fill, so recording one fill cost the size of every fill ever recorded. A fill
 * now touches its own day's record and nothing else (see `utils/chunked-history.js`
 * for the reasoning behind chunking; this store keeps its own read-merge-write
 * per bucket instead of that helper's diff, because two tabs may both be
 * appending to today's record).
 *
 * The pre-split single key is migrated on the first load after the upgrade:
 * split into day records, then replaced by a per-character marker that says the
 * split has happened. The marker is what stops every later load from treating
 * the absent single key as a legacy value to adopt, and it makes a single key
 * that comes back — an older tab still writing it, a sync pull from a device
 * on the old layout — something to fold into the day records rather than a
 * history to migrate over them. A split that cannot be written (a full disk)
 * leaves the single key in place and the store keeps using it as before.

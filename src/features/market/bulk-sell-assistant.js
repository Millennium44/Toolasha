/**
 * Bulk Sell Assistant
 *
 * Sells the whole inventory through the market one item at a time with one
 * game action per click. A Bulk Sell button in the marketplace tab bar (next
 * to Market History) shows/hides the floating control panel.
 * Start builds a queue of tradable inventory items —
 * optionally limited to one Toolasha custom inventory tab (children included);
 * for each item it navigates to its order book, decides between insta-selling
 * (ask supply exceeds bid demand, the front of the ask queue is older than
 * the configured threshold — the queue isn't moving —, the stack is under the
 * minimum listing value, or the ask−bid spread is under the configured
 * percentage) and posting a sell listing, then opens the matching modal with
 * the quantity prefilled.
 * Confirming (or closing) the modal advances to the next item automatically,
 * so after Start every sale is exactly one click — always in the same place.
 *
 * That click can be the game's own confirm button or the Confirm button on the
 * assistant's strip, which presses the game's for you so a long run never moves
 * the cursor. Both are the same sale: the strip's button only causes the press,
 * and the modal closing is still the one thing that advances the walk. So the
 * assistant does press the game's confirm button — but only for a press of
 * yours, only while the open modal is selling exactly the item, enhancement
 * level and quantity this step queued, and only once per step. One click of
 * yours is still one sale; it is no longer the game's button that has to
 * receive it.
 *
 * Confirm and Next occupy the strip's one primary slot — the button that would
 * otherwise sit idle between the two halves of every step — so a run is a
 * repeated click in one place rather than a press here, a press there. Skip
 * keeps its own slot beside it: sharing the primary slot would make an
 * impatient extra click skip an item that was one press from selling.

 * These are localised. A client running in another language shows a translated

 * confirm button was not found" — it fails closed and says so, and the game's
 * own button still works. The game exposes no i18next global to translate

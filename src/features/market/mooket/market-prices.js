/**
 * Market Prices
 *
 * A price cache that remembers how much was resting at the top of each book,
 * not just what it cost.
 *
 * Adapted from mooket II by Q7 (MIT). See docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md.
 *
 * The game's marketplace.json publishes a best ask and a best bid and nothing
 * else — no size. That is enough to say what an item is worth and useless for
 * saying whether you can trade it: a 40k spread with one unit at the ask is a
 * curiosity, the same spread with eight hundred is a trade. The order books the
 * game pushes when you open an item do carry size, so a sighting seen that way
 * is kept with its quantities. Readings are folded newest-wins by timestamp,
 * though: a fresher marketplace.json snapshot (which carries no size) replaces
 * an older order-book reading and resets its sizes to zero, so a stored size
 * lasts only until the next snapshot re-reads that item. Consumers that need
 * depth must treat a zero size as "unknown", not "none listed".
 *
 * Pure: entries in, entries out. Storage and sockets live in the feature module.

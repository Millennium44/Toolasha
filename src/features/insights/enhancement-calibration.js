/**
 * Enhancement calibration
 *
 * Writes down, for every enhancement session that reached its target, where the
 * run landed in the distribution the calculator predicted for it.
 *
 * The enhancement tracker already keeps both halves: the prediction taken at
 * session start (mean, variance and physical minimum of the attempt count, all
 * off one Markov chain) and the attempts the run actually took. Nobody compares
 * them, so a chain that is quietly wrong about a tier of gear reads exactly
 * like one that is right. Unlike the profit calibrations, one session is never
 * "predicted 41, took 63, therefore off by 54%" — the distribution is heavy
 * tailed and a single draw only means anything as a percentile. That percentile
 * is what gets stored, and a *pattern* in the percentiles is what would convict
 * the chain: a calibrated model scatters them evenly, a flattering one piles
 * them up at the unlucky end.
 *
 * ## What counts as an observation
 *
 * A session that reached the target it was predicted for, whose prediction
 * carries its distribution. A session stopped by hand is censored — its attempt
 * count says where the player gave up, not where the run would have ended — and
 * a session recorded before the variance was stored has no distribution to be
 * a percentile of. Neither is an observation; recording them anyway would be
 * filling the ledger with numbers that mean nothing.
 *
 * The observed count is the current leg's — after an extension the prediction
 * was recomputed from the extension point, so the attempts diffed against it
 * must start there too.

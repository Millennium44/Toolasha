/**
 * Prediction calibration
 *
 * Keeps the profit calculators honest by writing down what they promised and
 * what the run actually paid.
 *
 * Every profit figure in this script is a forecast: drop rates times prices
 * times an efficiency model, none of which anybody checks against a finished
 * run. A stale price, a buff the model does not know about or a drop table the
 * game changed all read the same way — a confident number that is quietly wrong
 * for weeks. The loot log already records what each run produced, so the
 * comparison costs nothing but the bookkeeping.
 *
 * ## What counts as a pair
 *
 * A prediction is snapshotted for the **running** action, the moment it is first
 * seen, because that is when the gear, teas and prices behind the forecast are
 * the ones the run is actually being played with. The pair is written when that
 * run is superseded by a newer one — the game's own signal that it finished.
 *
 * Runs that were already over when the page loaded are deliberately skipped. A
 * prediction computed now against a run played under yesterday's gear is not a
 * calibration measurement, it is noise dressed as one.
 *
 * ## Nothing here is written by hand
 *
 * The predicted side calls the same `calculateGatheringProfit` /
 * `calculateProductionProfit` the action panels display, and the actual side
 * uses the loot log's own profit arithmetic. Reimplementing either would mean
 * this feature could disagree with the panels and still call itself calibrated.

/**
 * Goal Planner panel
 *
 * A list of what you are working towards, and the ordered steps to get there.
 *
 * The panel deliberately does no arithmetic. It collects a goal, hands it to
 * `goal-planner.js` with a context built from the live calculators, and draws
 * what comes back — so anything a number here disagrees with the rest of
 * Toolasha about is a bug in one calculator rather than a second opinion grown
 * inside a panel.
 *
 * ## Refresh is a button, not a timer
 *
 * Ranking every activity the character can do means running the profit
 * calculators a few hundred times. That is not something to do every five
 * seconds behind somebody's back, and it is not something whose answer changes
 * minute to minute. So the plan is computed on demand, the market age it was
 * priced at is printed next to the totals, and the last result is kept so the
 * panel has something to show the moment it opens.
 *
 * *Planning* is not that expensive, though, and the two are now separate.
 * Adding or removing a goal replans every goal immediately against the context
 * already priced — which it has to, because the goals share one bagful of
 * inputs and a removed goal's claims belong to the goals below it. Refresh
 * remains the only thing that goes back to the market.
 *
 * ## Steps that are already done stay on screen
 *
 * A plan re-costed after you bought the base item shows that step struck
 * through rather than one step shorter. Watching steps grey out is the progress
 * bar; a list that silently gets smaller is just a list you no longer trust.
 *
 * ## A step that says "buy 40 materials" can go and buy them
 *
 * Toolasha already knows how to send a shopping list to the marketplace: the
 * missing-materials button does it for an action, `utils/shopping-list.js` does
 * it for a restock, and both are the same three pieces —
 * `createMaterialTab`, `createAutofillManager`, `navigateToMarketplace`. A step
 * that names a purchase gets a button onto whichever of those already fits, so
 * the planner adds an entry point rather than a fourth implementation of
 * marketplace tabs.
 *
 * The list lives in `utils/` rather than beside the consumables panel because
 * this panel is in a different bundle from that one, and a copy each meant two
 * modules with their own tab state fighting over the one marketplace tab bar.

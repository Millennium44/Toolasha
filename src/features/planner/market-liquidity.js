/**
 * How fast a market will actually absorb what a method produces.
 *
 * ## The hole this closes
 *
 * A gold rate is a claim about *realizing* gold, and every step between the
 * action and the coins was modelled except the last one: somebody has to buy
 * what you made. The planner would rank a method at 134.3B/hr because its
 * outputs are priced at 134.3B/hr of ask, on a book where one unit changes hands
 * a week. You cannot sell into a market that is not there. The price is real and
 * the rate is fiction.
 *
 * The `sustainable` cap already says "a rate is only a rate while its inputs
 * last". This is the same sentence about the other end: *a rate is only a rate
 * while somebody is buying.*
 *
 * ## Where the number comes from
 *
 * The pooled market history Toolasha already fetches for the history chart. Each
 * row carries a traded volume, and `buildHistorySeries` already turns rows into
 * per-day volume with the ask/bid split the chart's tooltip shows. Summing that
 * over a window and dividing gives units per day, client-side, with no
 * order-book round trips — the same data the user is looking at when they say
 * "this thing sells once a week".
 *
 * Total volume rather than only the sell-into-bid half: a player selling can
 * either hit the bid or post an ask and wait to be lifted, and both are units of
 * that item changing hands. Counting only one side would halve every answer for
 * no reason.
 *
 * ## The two judgement calls, and why
 *
 * **You are not the only seller.** {@link LIQUIDITY_SHARE} is the fraction of
 * observed trade this character is assumed to be able to capture. A quarter is
 * already aggressive — it says one in every four units traded market-wide is
 * yours — and anything higher is not a share of the market, it is a claim to
 * *be* the market. It is deliberately a single constant rather than something
 * clever about spreads: the point is a sanity bound, and a bound nobody can
 * explain is worse than a blunt one.
 *
 * **A week is the horizon.** {@link LIQUIDITY_HORIZON_DAYS} is how far ahead a
 * total is allowed to count. A windfall you can only unwind over eight months
 * is not money the next step of a plan can spend, so what a method is worth is
 * what it can be turned into inside a week at the pace the book will take.
 *
 * ## Absence of data is not data showing absence
 *
 * Two different unknowns, and conflating them would either break the planner or
 * lie to it:
 *
 * - **The history is not available** — the pooled-history setting is off, or the
 *   server did not answer. Nothing is known about any item, so nothing is
 *   bounded and the panel says out loud that it is not checking. Crushing every
 *   rate to zero because a third-party server is down would be conservative in
 *   the same way that unplugging the computer is.
 * - **The history is available and shows no trades** — that *is* an answer, and
 *   it is the answer the user is complaining about. It bounds normally, all the
 *   way to zero if the pool watched the item for a month and saw nothing.

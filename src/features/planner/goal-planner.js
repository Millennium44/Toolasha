/**
 * Goal Planner engine
 *
 * You say where you want to end up; this says what to do first.
 *
 * Every number here already exists somewhere in Toolasha — the enhancement
 * Markov chain, the buy-vs-craft comparison, the profit-per-hour calculators,
 * the house upgrade costs. What none of them can answer on their own is the
 * ordinary question a player actually has: *"I want Sinister Cape +10 — what
 * does that cost me, and in what order?"* Answering it means putting four
 * calculators end to end and admitting that the third one's bill has to be paid
 * out of the first one's income.
 *
 * ## Why this module is pure
 *
 * Nothing here reads the game, the market or the DOM. Everything arrives in a
 * context object — levels, coins, prices, and a handful of provider functions
 * that wrap the real calculators (see `goal-planner-context.js`). That split is
 * not tidiness: the interesting behaviour is *the choice between two costed
 * options*, and a choice is only testable when the fixture can put its thumb on
 * the scale. "Buying the base is cheaper than crafting it" and "crafting it is
 * cheaper" are the same code down two price fixtures, and there is no way to
 * write the second test against a live market.
 *
 * ## Steps carry their prerequisites
 *
 * A plan is not a list, it is a partial order. Coins have to be earned before
 * they are spent, and a craft that needs Crafting 70 has to wait for Crafting
 * 70. Each step names the steps it waits on and {@link orderSteps} flattens
 * that into the sequence to read top to bottom, so the ordering rule lives in
 * one place rather than in four `push()` calls that happen to be in the right
 * order today.
 *
 * ## Satisfied steps are marked, not dropped
 *
 * A plan re-costed against a character who has since bought the base item
 * should show the acquisition step struck through, not silently one step
 * shorter. The struck-through step is the evidence the plan is the same plan.
 *
 * ## A rate is only a rate while its inputs last
 *
 * The single largest source of nonsense a planner can produce is treating a
 * one-shot margin as an hourly income. Decomposing a Sundering Crossbow ★ you
 * happen to own might net 850M in seven seconds; extrapolated that is 437
 * *billion* an hour, and a funding step that quotes it tells you a 900M goal
 * takes seven seconds. It does — once. You own one crossbow.
 *
 * So every rate may carry a {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_capital
 * sustainability cap}: `rate.sustainable.gold` is the most gold that method can
 * produce before the thing it consumes runs out. {@link planEarnings} then
 * spends the shortfall down the ranking — take the best rate up to its cap,
 * then the next — so a plan reads "decompose the one crossbow you have, then
 * grind" rather than "decompose crossbows for seven seconds". A rate with no
 * cap (gathering, production, combat: their inputs are gathered or bought at
 * ask) is unbounded and covers whatever is left in one leg.
 *
 * A leg that cannot last {@link RATE_HORIZON_HOURS} is not described as a rate
 * at all, because "per hour" is a claim about an hour. It is described as what
 * it is: a fixed number of units for a fixed number of coins.
 *
 * ## And you only own the crossbow once
 *
 * The cap above is per plan, and a player has several. Two goals planned
 * independently will both decompose the same crossbow, both spend the same coins
 * in hand, and between them promise 1.7B out of an 851M item. Each plan is right
 * and the pair is nonsense.
 *
 * So {@link planGoals} runs the goals through a {@link createResourceLedger
 * ledger}: goals are planned in the order they are shown, each one against what
 * the ones above it have already claimed. The first goal takes the crossbow, the
 * second sees a rate with nothing left and falls through to the next-best method
 * — which is exactly what the sustainability cap already does when a stack runs
 * out, so there is one fallback rule rather than two.
 *
 * A silent re-rank would be worse than the bug, though. "Milk a Cow" appearing
 * where "Decompose Sundering Crossbow ★" was reads as the planner changing its
 * mind. So the step that lost its inputs says who took them:
 * *Sundering Crossbow ★ already spent by 'Cheesesmithing 108'*.

 * `buildPlannerContext` — a few hundred profit calculations to rank every
 * activity — and that still happens exactly once, before this is called. What
 * the ledger adds is one pass over the rate list per goal (to subtract what has
 * been claimed) plus a walk of each finished plan's steps, so replanning N goals
 * is O(N × rates) on top of the O(N) planning that was already happening. With
 * the rate list capped in the low hundreds and goal lists in the low tens, that
 * is microseconds against a refresh measured in seconds.
 *
 * Which is why every goal is replanned whenever any goal changes rather than
 * patched: the plans are no longer independent, and the memoised providers on
 * the context mean the second pass over the same goals costs almost nothing.

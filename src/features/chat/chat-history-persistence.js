/**
 * Chat History Persistence
 *
 * The history buffer that `chat-history-extender.js` keeps above live chat is
 * lost on every reload, because it is built from `cloneNode(true)` of nodes the
 * game has already thrown away. This module writes that markup to IndexedDB and
 * puts it back on the next load.
 *
 * ## Why the markup, and why the links have to be rebuilt
 *
 * A live message is made clickable by reading its React fiber props at clone
 * time — `props.onClick`, `props.goToMarketplaceHandler` — and keeping the
 * *function references* in a map. Functions do not serialize, so nothing that
 * comes back off disk can carry the game's own callbacks. Restored item links
 * are therefore re-wired to this script's own navigation
 * (`navigateToMarketplace`), resolved from the icon sprite the markup already
 * carries, and a link whose item cannot be resolved is left inert: it loses
 * `.mwi-interactive` too, because a pointer cursor over a dead link is worse
 * than a plain one.
 *
 * Player names this script itself decorated travel with the message: the name
 * attribute and the class that styles it are both kept, so the delegated
 * listener in `chat-profile-link.js` works on a restored message without
 * waiting for anything to re-decorate it. This used to claim that decorator
 * would re-link them wherever they appeared; it does not, because it skips any
 * node that already carries its class — which a restored one does.
 *
 * The *sender* name of an ordinary chat line is the game's own element
 * (`ChatMessage_name ChatMessage_clickable`), carries no attribute of ours, and
 * is clickable only through a React handler — so it dies with the session
 * exactly like an item link does, and is re-wired here the same way. The name
 * is read back out of the `CharacterName_name` text the markup already carries
 * rather than from anything saved, which is what lets messages stored long
 * before this existed come back clickable with no migration. A sender whose
 * name cannot be read or does not look like a player name loses
 * `ChatMessage_clickable` as well, for the same reason an unresolvable item
 * link loses `.mwi-interactive`: on a restored node that class is a promise
 * nothing can keep.
 *
 * ## Why it never leaves the device
 *
 * Every tab is persisted, whispers and private messages included — a deliberate
 * choice, made knowing this puts private conversations on disk. Disk is the
 * whole of it: the cross-device sync uploads to a GitHub gist, and a whisper
 * reaching a gist would be a real privacy failure. The key is prefixed
 * `toolasha_local_`, which `features/sync/sync-payload.js` strips from the
 * settings store on the upload path (`redactSettingsStore`) and again on the
 * import path (`applyPayload`), and which `utils/full-backup.js` strips from
 * every manual backup file as well.
 *
 * The `settings` store is used rather than a store of this feature's own,
 * because a new object store means a `dbVersion` bump and this database's
 * version is held in lockstep with the upstream script that shares it — see
 * `core/storage.js`. A store-level exclusion would also have been needed then,
 * since `buildPayloadJSON('everything')` walks every store `listStores()`
 * reports; keeping the record in `settings` puts it under the key-prefix
 * exclusion that already exists and is already applied on both paths.
 *
 * ## Caps
 *
 * Markup for a dozen tabs at 150 messages each is not small, so three caps hold
 * the write down and every one of them trims oldest-first. See
 * {@link MAX_MESSAGE_CHARS}, {@link MAX_MESSAGES_PER_TAB} and
 * {@link MAX_TOTAL_CHARS}.
 *
 * ## Message identity and deletion
 *
 * A September 2026 patch (test server only as of this writing) lets a player
 * delete their own Trade/Recruit messages, on top of the moderator deletion
 * that already existed. Deletion arrives as `chat_message_updated`, carrying
 * `{ id, chan, isDeleted, deleteReason }` for the message it targets — no
 * text, no sender, nothing else. Removing the right stored message therefore
 * means keying by that `id`, which nothing here used before this patch: a
 * stored entry was, and still is, just an HTML string.
 *
 * Rather than change that shape (a new field would mean a `RECORD_VERSION`
 * bump and a migration for every existing record), the id rides *inside* the
 * markup: `chat-history-extender.js` stamps a live message's DOM node with
 * `data-mwi-msg-id` the moment it can correlate that node to the
 * `chat_message_received` websocket event that produced it, and
 * `serializeMessage` neither adds nor strips that attribute, so it survives
 * into storage as part of the HTML like any other attribute the game itself
 * wrote. {@link extractStoredMessageId} pulls it back out with a regex — a
 * full parse of every message in a tab on every deletion is more work than a
 * deletion (which can arrive in a burst, e.g. a moderator clearing a channel)
 * should cost.
 *
 * That correlation is only possible for a tab keyed `tab2:ch:<channel>` — an
 * aggregate channel like Trade or Global, where the websocket's `chan` field
 * names the same channel the open tab shows. A `tab2:name:<label>` tab
 * (whispers, or any tab the strip does not expose a channel for) has no such
 * 1:1 mapping — several whisper conversations can share one `chan` value — so
 * chat-history-extender does not attempt it there, and a message recorded
 * from one carries no id. So does every message recorded by a build before
 * this patch. {@link purgeMessageById} simply cannot find either kind: they
 * stay on disk until the ordinary caps age them out, same as before this
 * existed. That is a quiet miss, not a crash — deletion here is a courtesy on
 * top of a local cache, not a guarantee.
 *
 * An undelete (`chat_message_updated` with `isDeleted: false`) restores
 * nothing. The deleted message's markup is gone the moment it is purged;
 * there is nothing left to put back, and re-adding a message this script
 * never re-receives over the socket is not something an undelete event alone
 * can do.

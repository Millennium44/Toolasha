/**
 * Seeded RNG for the combat simulator.
 *
 * The engine draws random numbers constantly — spawn composition, hit and crit
 * rolls, parry, threat targeting, stun chance, proc chances. Left unseeded, two
 * sims of the same setup are independent samples, so an upgrade comparison
 * measures the upgrade's effect *plus* the gap between two random draws. That's
 * why sub-0.1% deltas flip sign between runs.
 *
 * Seeding both sims from one value gives them common random numbers: the shared
 * part of the stream cancels out of the difference and only the upgrade's real
 * effect is left. Draws are split into independent streams by purpose so a
 * player-side change can't shift monster-side draws — both sims walk the same
 * spawn sequence even after their combat rolls have diverged.
 *
 * With no seed set every draw falls through to Math.random(), which is the
 * previous behavior, so paths that want a fresh sample per run are untouched.

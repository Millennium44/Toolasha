/**
 * Labyrinth Level Finder
 *
 * The highest room level a character still clears at a given rate, found by
 * binary search over simulated fights.
 *
 * This is the same question the labyrinth panel's Recommend button asks, and it
 * is deliberately answered over the same window and against the same bar. The
 * two used to disagree: this search ran a fixed 20–300 at a fixed 95%, which
 * stopped short of what a high-level character can clear, wasted probes below
 * the floor for a low-level one, and measured against a bar nothing else in the
 * script uses. The window now comes from the character — every room level the
 * automation table could send them to — and the bar from the shared setting.

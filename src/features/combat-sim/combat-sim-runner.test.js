/**
 * How a simulation decides to spend the machine.
 *
 * There are two ways to spend four workers on eight candidates: split each
 * candidate four ways and do them one at a time, or give each candidate one
 * worker and run four at once. The same hours get simulated either way, so it
 * reads like a wash — and it is not. Splitting pays the worker startup and the
 * game-data clone once per chunk instead of once per candidate, and it cannot
 * start the next candidate until its own slowest chunk lands. Measured on four
 * workers: 3.3× slower at a hundred hours a candidate, still 1.14× slower at
 * five seconds of work apiece, and never once faster.
 *
 * Splitting is right for a *lone* run, where there is no queue to keep full —
 * one 600-hour simulation is about twice as quick across four workers. So the
 * rule is: fan out a single run, queue a batch.

/**
 * A worker that stops answering, and the pool it would otherwise freeze.
 *
 * The chunk promise settles only from a message or an `error` event. A worker
 * the browser kills for memory fires neither, so the promise used to hang for
 * the life of the page — and worse than one lost result, its wrapper stayed in
 * `activeWorkers`, which is exactly what the idle reaper is busy-guarded on. One
 * dead worker and every warm worker plus its clone of the game data was held for
 * the rest of the session.

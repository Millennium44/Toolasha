/**
 * The best set of upgrades a budget will buy, on one improvement axis.
 *
 * The planner itself lives in the upgrade advisor and speaks labyrinth: it
 * values a candidate by how far it drives `attemptsDelta` below zero. Combat
 * results have no attempts, so the gain on the chosen axis goes in negated —
 * "one fewer attempt" and "one more coin per hour" are the same arithmetic, and
 * the slot-conflict rules that stop it buying two chestpieces are the part
 * worth reusing.
 *
 * Combat levels are dropped: they are not purchases, so a list of what a budget
 * buys has nothing to say about them.
 *
 * ## Why it plans twice
 *
 * `planWithinBudget` throws away every row whose gain has not cleared the
 * simulation's own error bar, and on the profit axis that is very nearly every
 * row. The error model is per-encounter and deliberately coarse — a run of a few
 * thousand encounters carries a couple of percent of noise, and 1.96σ of it is
 * four or five — while a real profit gain from one piece of gear is a fraction
 * of a percent. So a table full of affordable, positive, sensibly-priced rows
 * planned to *nothing at all*, and the panel said "nothing fits 500M", which is
 * not what it had measured and not what the reader could see.
 *
 * "Not proven" is not "worth zero". The first pass still prefers the rows that
 * cleared their error bar, because a plan made of measurements is worth more
 * than one made of point estimates. Only when that pass buys nothing does the
 * second one run over everything, and what comes back is flagged `provisional`
 * so the panel can say which of the two it is looking at.

 * item — a level is a shopping list of materials, and a multi-level jump is
 * several of those lists — so it carries `house` instead of an item to reserve:
 * a room-level *goal*, which Equipment Savings keeps beside the gear and ability
 * targets, and a `materials` list. The Market button is offered for the one
 * material the bill is mostly made of, with the rest named in its tooltip, so
 * nobody clicks it believing one tab covers the room. A level whose materials
 * are all coin has no marketable line and gets no Market button.
 *
 * Ability rows are a purchase — the books are ordinary marketplace goods — so
 * they can be watched, bought at the market, and saved for. Saving for one is
 * not the gear list's slot-by-slot reservation, which a stack of books could
 * never fill; it is an ability *goal*, which Equipment Savings keeps beside the
 * gear targets. `ability` carries what that goal needs, and `savable` stays
 * about the slot reservation so nothing downstream conflates the two.
 *
 * `quantity` is how many of the item the row actually has you buy. For gear that
 * is one — a slot holds one sword — but an ability row is priced in *books*, and
 * "go to the market" for a row costing 140M of Berserk books meant arriving at a
 * buy box defaulted to 1 with the real figure left in the table behind you. It

     * day of it levels, how fast it kills and whether it kills you — and every
     * one of them was previously several sections apart, with the profit figure
     * last of all because it depends on the drop and consumable tables. Those
     * tables still hold the working; this holds the conclusions, and takes them
     * from the same variables the tables printed rather than recomputing.
     *
     * Profit and deaths are quoted per day: nobody fights a zone for an hour,
     * and a day is the unit a player weighs against the other things they
     * could be doing. XP is per hour, the same unit the XP section below and
     * every zone ranking use, so the tile can be read against them directly;
     * a dungeon's pace reads best as the average length of one clear.

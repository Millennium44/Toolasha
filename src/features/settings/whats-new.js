/**
 * What's New — the once-per-update popup, and the conservative-defaults policy.
 *
 * Two jobs that share one piece of bookkeeping. The bookkeeping is a stored
 * record of which build spoke last and which setting IDs the user has already
 * been shown; the popup announces whatever is new since, and the policy — for
 * people who would rather their script never changed itself — forces any newly
 * arrived on-by-default switch off before the features read it.
 *
 * ## Why the policy runs before features initialise
 *
 * A switch turned off *after* startup has already run once. The whole promise
 * of "new settings start off" is that the new thing never happens, so the
 * entrypoint calls `applyPolicy()` between loading settings and initialising
 * features, and `maybeShow()` only after the page is up.
 *
 * ## Why the state is per character
 *
 * Settings themselves are per character, so "which settings have you been
 * shown" has to be too — a policy applied for one character and assumed for
 * another would leave the second character's new switches on.

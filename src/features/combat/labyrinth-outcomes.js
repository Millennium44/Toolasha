/**
 * Labyrinth Fight Outcomes — predicted against actual
 *
 * A simulation can converge on a precise wrong answer, and no number of
 * extra trials will say so — only the game can. The server counts the
 * fights for us: a room beaten on the fifth try is one clear in five, and a
 * room walked away from is nought in however many. Set beside the rate the
 * sim predicted, that is a test the sim can fail.
 *
 * Mixed into LabyrinthClearRate, so every method here reads and writes the
 * singleton's own state (`this._outcomes`, `this._baseline`) and leans on its
 * forecasting methods for the prediction each observation is judged against.

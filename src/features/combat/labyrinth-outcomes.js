/**
 * Labyrinth Fight Outcomes — predicted against actual
 *
 * A simulation can converge on a precise wrong answer, and no number of
 * extra trials will say so — only the game can. The server counts the
 * fights for us: a room beaten on the fifth try is one clear in five, and a
 * room walked away from is nought in however many. Set beside the rate the
 * sim predicted, that is a test the sim can fail.
 *
 * Mixed into LabyrinthClearRate, so every method here reads and writes the
 * singleton's own state (`this._outcomes`, `this._baseline`) and leans on its
 * forecasting methods for the prediction each observation is judged against.

 * from another. A tab that recorded fights before its read landed keeps them
 * only when its bucket is the larger; the alternative, summing, would double
 * every fight both sides already share. The seen-set and the baseline are one
 * tab's working state and memory's copy wins.
 *
 * A stored document of another version is not merged at all: the version bump
 * exists to drop it, and that drop is the one intentional overwrite here.
 *
 * Reset is the exception to "fuller wins", and the reason for `clearedAt`. An
 * emptied record loses that comparison every time - the peer's fuller bucket
 * wins the pull, and the fights the user explicitly disowned come back to both
 * devices, leaving the panel's accuracy verdict a statement about runs the user
 * threw away. So the reset stamps a single epoch on the document, unioned as a
 * max, and any bucket that stopped counting before it is dropped rather than
 * weighed. Each bucket carries `updatedAt` (`stampOutcomeUpdates`), so a bucket
 * the other device counted into *after* the reset outlives it - the ordering
 * hazard the epoch exists to answer, and what a boolean could not.
 *
 * `stored` is this device's copy in both callers - the save fold reads it back,

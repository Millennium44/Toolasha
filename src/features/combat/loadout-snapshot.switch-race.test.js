/**
 * A reconnect to the *same* character landing inside the snapshot read.
 *
 * `initialize()` already guarded its resumed tail with
 * `if (getStorageKey() !== storageKey) return;`, which catches a genuine
 * character switch — a switch test passes against the pre-fix source and
 * proves nothing. It does not catch a reconnect, which is `disable()` followed
 * by `initialize()` again under the *same* character: the storage key is
 * unchanged, so the suspended call's tail sails through the comparison and
 * does `this.characterInitializedHandler = …; dataManager.on(…)` on top of the
 * registration the fresh call already made. The field holds one handle, so the
 * fresh call's listener is orphaned — live, and unremovable — one per
 * interrupted reconnect.
 *
 * A character id alone cannot tell the two calls apart; a generation counter
 * can, which is what `utils/init-ownership.js` adds.

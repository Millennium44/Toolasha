/**
 * Combat unit badges
 *
 * Each party member's share of the damage, on the face of the person doing it.
 *
 * The DPS panel and the trial scoreboard both rank the party, and a ranked list
 * is the wrong shape for the question asked mid-fight — "is *that* one pulling
 * their weight" while looking straight at them. `portrait-dps.js` already
 * answers the rate half of that for this client's own fights. Two things it
 * does not do, and this file exists for both:
 *
 * - **The share.** A rate is only readable against the party's; "1.2K/s" says
 *   nothing without knowing whether that is a third of the party or a
 *   twentieth. The share is the figure a guild argues about.
 * - **A guild trial.** A trial fight runs on the server and reaches this client
 *   over `guild_battle_updated`, not over its own battle feed — so the damage
 *   tracker knows nothing about it, and the fight view's portraits sit there
 *   unlabelled through the one fight where twenty names most need telling
 *   apart. The trial split is read through `liveTrialSplit`, which is the
 *   attribution module's own summary; no arithmetic is repeated here.
 *
 * ## Where the badge is anchored, and why it keeps coming back
 *
 * On the tile, in its flow, as the last child — the battle panel clips its
 * children, so anything hung outside the tile's box is drawn and cropped away.
 * Tiles come in two shapes and both are badged: the full `CombatUnit` card, and
 * the `MiniUnit` line the game draws for everybody except the watcher in a
 * spectated trial. A trial where only one of twenty-odd portraits could carry a
 * figure would be the feature's worst case, and the mini units are the twenty.
 *
 * A mini unit is fifty pixels wide with its name along the top, so its badge is
 * a **compact** one — the rate alone, a point smaller, pinned to the tile's
 * bottom edge out of the flow so it cannot push the name anywhere. See
 * {@link COMPACT_MARK}.
 *
 * The join is the **name** on the tile, never its position. A slot is a
 * position in this fight; the moment somebody leaves, every index after them
 * means a different person, and a badge joined by index puts one player's
 * damage on another's face. A tile whose name is not in the table gets no badge
 * rather than somebody else's.
 *
 * Every selector is a prefix match, because the game's class names carry a
 * build hash (`CombatUnit_combatUnit__1p2q3`) that changes with every update.
 * This is the fragile end of the script and it fails by drawing nothing.
 *
 * ## Re-attaching, which is the whole lifecycle problem
 *
 * React rebuilds the battle panel whenever the fight changes and whenever the
 * Combat tab is left and returned to, taking every injected node with it.
 * Anchors captured once go stale — the failure KikiMeter documents and solves
 * by re-attaching on an observer. Same answer here, in this fork's own shape:
 * the badges are re-drawn from scratch on a `domObserver` registration
 * (debounced, because a game tick fires it dozens of times over) and on a
 * one-second timer, and each badge carries a `data-` attribute so a rebuild
 * that *did* keep it produces one badge rather than two.
 *
 * A tick never writes to the DOM. The timer is the only cadence, and a draw
 * that produces the same text as the last one touches nothing.
 *
 * Off by default: the portraits are already carrying health, mana and an
 * ability bar, and a purely visual addition to a crowded tile should be asked
 * for rather than assumed.
 *
 * The idea of a per-unit live meter is DPs', from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty
 * (MIT), and of a class-and-share readout in a trial KikiMeter's by ZhuLiMoon
 * (MIT) — see `third-party/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

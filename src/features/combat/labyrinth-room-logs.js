/**
 * Labyrinth Room Logs
 *
 * What actually happened in each room, and — for fights — whether the sim was
 * right about it.
 *
 * Skilling and enhancing rooms announce every action they take, so their logs
 * are a direct transcript. Combat rooms announce nothing of the sort: the tile
 * badge quotes a clear chance computed before you walked in, the fight happens,
 * and then the tile is either cleared or it is not. Standing those two side by
 * side is the only way to find out whether the number was ever true.
 *
 * Two views, because they answer different questions. The room list is "how did
 * this run go" — grouped by floor, with what each floor cost and returned; the
 * accuracy view is "does the calculator know what it is talking about", which
 * needs every room ever recorded rather than the last few floors.
 *
 * Reached from a tab beside Lab Sim, which is up whether or not a run is in
 * progress: reviewing a run is something you do after it.
 *
 * Ported in part from dakonglong's MIT-licensed Labyrinth Clear Rate Calculator.

 * Sum a fight's attribution tally into your swing counts. Crits ride along —
 * damage-per-hit compares real against sim, and a real crit rate below what your
 * crit buffs imply is the sim over-crediting crits (a soft-hit gap that isn't the
 * monster's mitigation); a matching crit rate points the soft-hit gap back at the
 * monster instead. Recorded so a later export can tell the two apart.
 *
 * Damage-over-time ticks come along for the same reason and are counted apart
 * from the swings: a tick rings the monster's damage counter but never the
 * player's attack counter, and it lands for a fraction of the blow that applied
 * it. The ratio of ticks to swings is what the replay puts beside the sim's to
 * decide whether a soft-hit gap is the monster's mitigation or just a mix the
 * sim gets wrong.
 *
 * Their DAMAGE comes along beside their count, and it is what makes
 * damage-per-hit an honest comparison rather than a mixed one. `foldEvents`
 * folds `dotDamage` inside `damage` deliberately, so every total that existed
 * before it stayed right — but the fight's damage total is then the whole of
 * what the monster lost while the hit count is swings alone, and dividing one
 * by the other counts damage-over-time in the numerator and not in the
 * denominator. Recording the subtotal lets the replay take it back out.

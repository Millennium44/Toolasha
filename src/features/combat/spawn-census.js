/**
 * Spawn Census
 *
 * A long-running tally of which monsters a combat wave actually contains.
 *
 * The combat simulator predicts dungeon clears several percent long, and the
 * largest identified cause is the wave-draw rule: `combat-sim/engine/zone.js`
 * reads a dungeon's `randomSpawnInfoMap` keys as exclusive ranges and draws the
 * whole wave from the single highest key reached, and 138 recorded waves of
 * Chimerical Den say that is nearly but not quite what the game does — about one
 * wave in seven is a well-formed draw from a strictly *lower* table, which the
 * current reading gives probability zero. Settling that needs many more waves
 * than 138, from more zones and more tiers.
 *
 * Diagnosing it so far has meant full tick recordings: megabytes for half an
 * hour, capped by a timer, and overwhelmingly not about spawns at all. This
 * keeps the spawn signal and nothing else, cheaply enough to leave running for
 * weeks.
 *
 * ## Counts, not a timeline
 *
 * The question is "how often does each roster occur", so the multiset of rosters
 * with their frequencies is a sufficient statistic and a timeline is not needed
 * for anything. Two waves with the same monsters at the same wave number are
 * interchangeable, so the second one costs a counter increment rather than a new
 * record, and the roster list is **sorted** so that the same monsters drawn in a
 * different order collapse onto the same row too.
 *
 * Storage then grows with the number of *distinct* rosters rather than with
 * playtime — which is the whole point, and also, honestly, does not flatten as
 * fast as one would like: see {@link MAX_ROSTER_ROWS}.
 *
 * ## What is kept beside the rosters
 *
 * - **Wave duration**, as count / sum / sum-of-squares of the milliseconds from
 *   one wave's announcement to the next, per (zone, tier, wave). Three numbers
 *   give a mean and a standard error without storing a timestamp per wave. This
 *   span **includes the respawn gap** — it is announcement to announcement, not
 *   first hit to last death — and the export says so.
 * - **Observed max hitpoints** per (zone, tier, monster), one row per species
 *   per tier, overwritten. So a later analysis need not re-derive tier scaling
 *   to check a roster's total strength against the game's cap.
 *
 * Nothing here records a character, a name, a party, or anything that came off
 * an account. A row is a zone, a tier, a wave number and a list of monsters.

/**
 * How many distinct roster rows the store will hold.
 *
 * ### Why it is a cap and not a saturation point
 *
 * The pleasant story about aggregation is that distinct rosters run out. They do
 * not, quickly, at this key. Take Chimerical Den's key-0 table: 13 species,
 * `maxSpawnCount` 4, strengths 40-65 against a 250 budget, so most waves are
 * four monsters. Four-species multisets from thirteen is C(16,4) = 1820, and
 * with the shorter waves about 2400 rosters are reachable — for **one** wave
 * number. Fifty wave numbers per difficulty tier, and the upper tables are
 * wider (16-17 species, 5 slots) rather than narrower.
 *
 * Against that, two weeks of heavy play is perhaps 1300 clears, 65,000 waves,
 * of which maybe 30,000 are distinct. So the row count is set by memory, not by
 * the combinatorics running out, and this number is chosen to bound the file:
 *
 * A row's key is `<zone>|<tier>|<wave>|<four short monster names>`, around 55
 * characters, and its value serializes as `[count, firstSeen, lastSeen]` with
 * second-resolution timestamps, around 30 more. Call it 100 bytes of JSON per
 * row with the punctuation. 10,000 rows is therefore about 1 MB — a large
 * record by this database's standards but a small one in absolute terms, read
 * once at startup and written every {@link FLUSH_MS}.
 *
 * ### What eviction costs
 *
 * Least-recently-seen, and **not** the neutral choice it looks like. For
 * roughly Poisson arrivals, least-recently-seen and least-frequently-seen are
 * close to the same ordering: a roster drawn once a week has an old `last` and a
 * roster drawn every minute never does, so eviction removes the rare rosters
 * first — exactly the tail the wave-draw question lives in. Evicting by count
 * would have done that openly; this does it quietly.
 *
 * The second half of the bias is worse than the first. A row that survives keeps
 * the count it accumulated over the *whole* history, while an evicted row
 * contributes zero, so the retained table mixes full-history counts with
 * counts truncated to nothing. It is therefore not "the same census over a
 * shorter window": relative frequencies past the cap are skewed towards the
 * common rosters and no amount of care with `retainedFrom` undoes it.
 *
 * What follows from that is a usage rule rather than a code change: rows are
 * trustworthy as frequencies only while `evictedRows` is zero. The export says
 * so in `conventions.eviction`, and `evicted` / `retainedFrom` travel with the
 * file so an analyst can check before treating the counts as a distribution.

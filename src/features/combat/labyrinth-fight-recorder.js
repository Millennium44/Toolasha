/**
 * Labyrinth fight recorder
 *
 * The calibration replay needs several fights of one monster to measure a rate.
 * The labyrinth hands out random rooms and only lets you fight one again by
 * failing it, so there is no farming a monster to a sample on demand. The way to
 * a sample is to stop trying to force one: keep every combat fight's damage
 * exchange, across runs and reloads, and let the ones you happen to meet often
 * accumulate.
 *
 * So this is passive and persistent. Every resolved combat fight is kept — no
 * arming, no targeting — with the gross damage each side dealt (summed from the
 * health that fell, so regen is not subtracted) and the gear it was fought in.
 * The replay pools whatever has piled up for the gear you are wearing now, which
 * is why each attempt carries a fingerprint: a gear change starts a fresh pool
 * rather than comparing fights fought on different gear against one sim.
 *
 * ## Why gross, and why fingerprinted
 *
 * Gross because the sim reports damage gross; net-of-regen made the monster look
 * weaker than it hit. Fingerprinted because the replay re-simulates with your
 * current loadout, and a fight fought on last week's gear is a fight against a
 * different character — pooling it would compare the sim to the wrong fights.
 *
 * ## Versioned
 *
 * The fingerprint's own definition changes over time — v2 added the combat
 * skill levels the sim reads, because a level-up moves the sim's answer without
 * moving an item; v3 added the ability kit and the house rooms, for the same
 * reason. Each attempt is stamped with the version it was fingerprinted under,
 * and readings never pool across versions: a v1, a v2 and a v3 fight are fights
 * against three different characters as far as the sim is concerned. Every
 * older cohort is kept, shown and counted — never deleted.
 *
 * ## Bounded
 *
 * A thousand fights, oldest dropped, at about 737 bytes a record: ~720 KB per
 * character. Saved replay inputs are referenced, not copied — forty distinct
 * builds at ~10.4 KB each, about 417 KB — so the whole pool is bounded at
 * roughly 1.17 MB however many builds are cycled through. See MAX_ATTEMPTS and
 * MAX_REPLAY_BUILDS for the arithmetic.
 * The number is doubled transiently by
 * `mergeAttempts`, which unions both devices' pools before slicing, so a
 * cross-device sync peaks at up to twice the cap in memory; that is the figure
 * to check against before raising it again. The upload is not the constraint:
 * the gist payload is gzipped and split into 900 KB chunks under a 9 MB
 * ceiling, and a pool of near-identical records is about the most compressible
 * text there is.
 *
 * The cap is age-ordered and version-blind, which is what keeps a migration
 * from starving the new cohort: a pre-migration attempt is by construction
 * older than every post-migration one, so it is always among the first to fall
 * off. There is deliberately no per-version reservation — reserving space for
 * the old cohort would let a stale version hold half the slots forever, and the
 * whole point of the cap is that history ages out. What a migration therefore
 * costs is that the older cohort shrinks as the new one fills, and once
 * MAX_ATTEMPTS current-version fights have accumulated the older records are
 * gone. That is the intended end state: they are kept while they are the only
 * history there is, and retired once they are not.

/**
 * Distinct saved builds the pool keeps replay inputs for.
 *
 * A saved build is a whole `buildPlayerDTO` — equipment, five abilities and six
 * consumables with their trigger lists, house rooms, guild and achievement
 * buffs, seventeen levels — plus crates, community buffs and the labyrinth
 * buffs: about **10.4 KB** of JSON, measured against a fully-kitted character.
 * Stored on every fight that was opened with a caught start, that is 1000 ×
 * 10.4 KB ≈ **10.9 MB** per character, doubled to ~21.8 MB at the sync union's
 * peak — past the sync's own 9 MB ceiling, against a pool that was 720 KB.
 *
 * Consecutive fights within a run share one build exactly, so the inputs are
 * interned: one copy per distinct build, each fight carrying a short
 * `replayBuildId` instead. That alone is bounded only by how often the player
 * changes gear, so the table is capped too, at the most recently fought builds.
 * A fight whose build falls off the table keeps every measurement it ever had
 * and simply reverts to the legacy path — replayable when its `fingerprint`
 * matches the current build. No fight history is ever lost to this cap.
 *
 * 40 × 10.4 KB ≈ **417 KB**, plus ~20 bytes of id on each of 1000 records, so
 * the pool lands at about **1.17 MB** per character and cannot exceed it no
 * matter how many builds are cycled through. The sync union's peak is twice
 * both caps, ~2.3 MB, comfortably inside the 9 MB ceiling — and the payload is
 * gzipped, where forty near-identical builds compress to very little.
 *
 * That is why MAX_ATTEMPTS stays at 1000: the fight history is the expensive
 * thing to rebuild (it accumulates passively over many runs and cannot be
 * farmed), the builds are not, and capping the builds bounds the new cost
 * without spending any of the old one.

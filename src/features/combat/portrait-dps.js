/**
 * Portrait DPS
 *
 * Each character's damage, drawn on their own portrait in the battle panel.
 *
 * The DPS tile already ranks the party, and a ranked list is the wrong shape for
 * the question people actually ask mid-fight, which is "is *that* one pulling
 * their weight" while looking straight at them. A figure on the portrait answers
 * it without a lookup between a name in a list and a face in a row.
 *
 * ## Matched by name, not by position
 *
 * The obvious join is index: the payload's player 0 is the leftmost portrait.
 * It is also the join that produced the bug this script has already had once —
 * a slot is a position in *this* fight, and the moment somebody leaves, every
 * index after them means a different person. The portraits carry their names in
 * the DOM, so the name is the join, and a portrait whose name is not in the
 * tally simply gets nothing rather than getting somebody else's damage.
 *
 * ## Attaching to a panel React owns
 *
 * The battle panel is rebuilt by the game whenever the fight changes, taking any
 * injected node with it. So the meters are re-attached on a `MutationObserver`
 * rather than created once, and each one is tagged with a `data-` attribute so a
 * rebuild that *did* keep them does not produce two.
 *
 * The class names carry a build hash — `CombatUnit_combatUnit__1p2q3` — which
 * changes with every game update, so every selector here is a prefix match. This
 * is the most fragile feature in the script for that reason: it reaches into the
 * game's own DOM rather than into the payload. It fails by drawing nothing.
 *
 * The idea is DPs', from MWI Combat Suite by Frotty (MIT) — see
 * `third-party/mwi-combat-suite/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

/**
 * @vitest-environment happy-dom
 *
 * Sim accuracy, checked on the three things that could make it lie.
 *
 * **The derivation**, against the same recorded Planet of the Eyes run the
 * attribution replays. A metric derived from real payloads is the only kind
 * worth comparing to a simulator, and the ways it can be wrong are all boundary
 * conditions — a fight cut off by the end of the recording counted as a fast
 * one, the ticks before the first `new_battle` filed under a fight they do not
 * belong to, monster counters carried between battles that reuse the same
 * indices.
 *
 * **The deviation arithmetic**, which is where a sign error would turn "your
 * damage is 10% under the prediction" into the opposite advice.
 *
 * **The noise margin**, which is the whole point: without one, six fights will
 * flag a disagreement every time, and a check that always says the simulator is
 * wrong is a check nobody reads twice.
 *
 * A DOM because the module registers an overlay row and builds a panel at import.

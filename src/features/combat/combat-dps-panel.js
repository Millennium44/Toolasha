/**
 * Who is carrying a normal fight, on the same board a guild trial gets.
 *
 * `guild-trial-scoreboard.js` answers "who did what" for a guild trial — ranks,
 * shares, bars, a rate per player and a tab per quantity. A party farming a
 * zone asks exactly the same question and had nowhere to ask it: the numbers
 * were already being collected (`damage-tracker.js` per player, and
 * `damage-taken-tracker.js` for what comes back), and the only place any of it
 * surfaced per player was the DPS panel's flat list and, since recently, a
 * badge on a portrait.
 *
 * So this is that panel, pointed at the run-side trackers. Everything about
 * *drawing* a ranked board — the headline, the tab strip, the row with its
 * share bar, the copy text — comes from `utils/damage-board.js`, which the
 * trial panel now draws with too. What is written here is the part that is
 * genuinely different: which tracker feeds which tab, and what each figure
 * honestly is.
 *
 * ## Three tabs, and the third one is not "healing done"
 *
 * - **Damage** — `damageBreakdown()`. Per player, including damage-over-time
 *   and reflect, which move a monster's health with no swing behind them.
 * - **Taken** — `takenBreakdown()`. Health actually lost, after mitigation, and
 *   a floor at that: damage healed on the same tick was never visible.
 * - **Healed** — the same tracker's `regen`, which is health *restored*: a
 *   heal, a life-steal and the game's own regeneration are one number here
 *   because nothing on the wire separates them. It is therefore healing
 *   **received**, not healing done, and it is labelled that way rather than
 *   being quietly ranked as if it credited a healer. The run side exposes no
 *   per-caster healing at all — that only exists for a spectated trial, where
 *   the stream carries a lone caster to attribute a rise to.
 *
 * ## A fourth tab that is not about the party at all
 *
 * - **Rotation** — your own abilities, from `rotation-tracker.js`. Three tabs of
 *   "who is carrying this" answer nothing you can act on mid-fight; the one
 *   thing you can change is your own bar, and the question there is per ability
 *   rather than per player: which of them fire, which are ready and cannot be
 *   paid for, and what each one buys per cast, per point of mana and per second
 *   of the cooldown it occupies. The starvation arithmetic is the guild trial
 *   support module's, generalised in `utils/rotation-audit.js` rather than
 *   written twice.
 *
 * ## Everything is the party's, and in a party nothing says who struck
 *
 * The attribution is `utils/damage-attribution.js`' and its limits are its own:
 * a tick where two players hit the same monster is split between them, and a
 * split is not a measurement. The panel says so once, at the top, rather than
 * footnoting each row — a reader who takes a shared-out estimate for a measured
 * figure has been misled by the panel.
 *
 * Off by default (`combatDpsPanel`), like every panel that has to be asked for.
 * Position, size, collapsed state and whether it was left open all live in
 * `panel-geometry` through `createPanel`, the same as the rest.
 *
 * The idea of a per-player meter for a normal fight is DPs', from MWI Combat
 * Suite by Frotty (MIT), and the board's shape is KikiMeter's by ZhuLiMoon
 * (MIT) — see `third-party/` and `docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`. The code is
 * Toolasha's own.

/**
 * Sim accuracy
 *
 * The recorded fight, replayed against what the simulator said would happen.
 *
 * Everything else in this script that quotes a combat number gets it from the
 * simulator — the upgrade advisor, the food optimiser, the task profit cards.
 * All of them are predictions, and none of them has ever been checked against
 * the thing it predicts. A simulator that is 15% optimistic about your damage
 * will still rank two swords in the right order, so no amount of comparing its
 * own outputs will ever notice; only a real fight can.
 *
 * The recorder already keeps real fights. This reads one back, derives what
 * actually happened from it, runs the sim for the same zone with the current
 * character, and puts the two side by side.
 *
 * ## What the payloads honestly support
 *
 * A recording is `new_battle` plus the `pMap`/`mMap` of every tick, so what can
 * be derived is exactly what the damage trackers already derive:
 *
 * - **Damage dealt**, from the same attribution the Damage panel uses — a hit is
 *   a monster's `dmgCounter` rising, and the size of it is the health that went
 *   with it.
 * - **Damage taken**, likewise from the player's counter rising.
 * - **Fight length**, from the gap between one `new_battle` and the next.
 * - **Experience and loot**, from the running totals `new_battle` carries on each
 *   player — see below.
 *
 * And what it does **not** support, which matters as much:
 *
 * - **No consumables.** Nothing in the feed says a drink was sipped or food
 *   eaten. If the recording was made with different drinks up than the sim is
 *   told about, the gap is that and not the engine.
 * - **Solo only.** In a party the monsters spread their damage across everyone
 *   and the kills are the party's, so neither figure means what the solo sim
 *   means. Party recordings are refused rather than quietly mis-compared.
 *
 * ## Experience and loot, which used to be written off
 *
 * This file used to say experience and drops were "not on the combat feed at
 * all". That was wrong, and wrong in the direction that cost the most: the half
 * of the simulator's output people actually plan around went unchecked because
 * of a sentence nobody re-read.
 *
 * `new_battle` carries each player's `totalSkillExperienceMap` and
 * `totalLootMap` — the running totals for the combat action in progress. The
 * recorder keeps `new_battle` whole, so they are already in every recording ever
 * made, and no extra subscription, no clock and no correlation window is needed:
 * the gains of one fight are the difference between the totals on the battle
 * that opened it and the totals on the battle that closed it. Window attribution
 * is exact by construction, and a checkpoint or a banked segment carries it for
 * free because both are derived from the same ticks.
 *
 * A running total only ever rises. When one falls, the combat action was
 * restarted underneath the recording and the difference is not a gain — that
 * fight's gains are recorded as unknown rather than as a negative number or a
 * spike.
 *
 * **Experience is compared. Loot is not.** The simulator reports
 * `experienceGained` per skill over its run, which is the same quantity the feed
 * reports, so the two go side by side with a band measured the same way as
 * everything else. It reports **no drop table at all** — `SimResult` carries
 * drop-rate *multipliers* and nothing that says which items fell — so there is
 * no predicted count to put beside the observed one. Building one from the
 * game's drop tables would be checking the game's own numbers against
 * themselves, which is a different question, is not what this panel is for, and
 * is already answered properly by the Drop Luck model. So loot is shown as
 * observed rates only, said plainly to be information rather than a comparison.
 *
 * ## The gear is snapshotted, because it used to be guessed
 *
 * A recording used to be stamped with when it was made and nothing else, and the
 * sim ran against whatever was worn at the moment you pressed the button. Change
 * a weapon between recording and checking — or record, go and enhance something,
 * then check — and the deviation was the weapon. The panel said so, which is
 * honest and useless: the caveat covered the whole result.
 *
 * So the loadout is captured when the recording starts, and again at every
 * segment rotation, and kept on the observation. What is captured is exactly
 * what the simulator reads: {@link captureLoadoutSnapshot} takes the adapter's
 * player DTO — the same one the check would otherwise have built fresh — and
 * keeps the parts that describe the character rather than the world. The check
 * then builds a current DTO and lays the snapshot over it, so a legacy
 * observation from before this existed keeps behaving exactly as it did.
 *
 * ## Fight length includes the gap after it
 *
 * A fight is measured from its `new_battle` to the next one, which takes in the
 * three seconds of respawn that follow it. That is deliberate: the sim's clock
 * runs through the respawn too, so its damage-per-second is over wall time and
 * not over time-in-combat. Measuring only the swinging would make the observed
 * rate look higher than predicted for no reason but the definition.
 *
 * **Every rate on both sides divides by that same clock**, and it is worth being
 * explicit because the decomposition is where a mismatch would hide. Observed:
 * the sum of `new_battle`-to-`new_battle` spans, respawns included, over the
 * fights that completed. Predicted: `simulatedTime`, which is the simulator's
 * whole elapsed clock — respawn intervals, player death and walk-back included.
 * Damage per second, swings per second and experience per second are all that
 * one denominator on each side. See {@link OBSERVED_CLOCK} and
 * {@link PREDICTED_CLOCK}, which the row tooltips are written from so the two
 * cannot drift apart in words while agreeing in code.
 *
 * ## What is actually simulated, which is not the recording
 *
 * The zone and the tier, for {@link SIM_HOURS} hours, with the recorded loadout
 * laid over the current character. **Not the waves that were recorded.** The
 * engine draws its own encounters from the zone's spawn table — the same weights,
 * spawn count and strength cap the game uses, plus a boss every tenth encounter —
 * so it is the *planet*, sampled independently, and not a replay of the rooms
 * that were actually fought.
 *
 * That is the right comparison for a rate and the wrong one for a total: two
 * samples of the same zone can draw different wave mixes, and only the observed
 * side's spread is measured, so a zone with very unlike waves in it carries more
 * uncertainty than the band admits. It also means the fight count is not part of
 * the simulation at all — recording twice as long narrows the observed band and
 * changes nothing about what is predicted.
 *
 * ## Beyond sampling noise
 *
 * Six fights is a small sample and a small sample disagrees with everything. So
 * each metric carries a margin: the 95% interval on the mean of the per-fight
 * values, widened in quadrature by a flat allowance for the simulator's own
 * randomness. A deviation inside the margin is reported and not flagged — it is
 * what two samples of the same thing look like. Only what is outside it is worth
 * arguing about, and with fewer than three fights nothing is.
 *
 * ## Saying how many more fights would settle it
 *
 * The band is honest and, on its own, a dead end: "±6.4%, differences inside
 * that band are not findings" tells you the sample is too small and not what
 * would fix it. The spread is already measured, so the answer is arithmetic —
 * the margin falls as one over the square root of the sample, so the fights
 * needed to reach a given band follow from the coefficient of variation this
 * zone actually showed. {@link sampleSizeFor} says it, and the panel offers it
 * as a record target, which is the whole loop closed.
 *
 * The one thing it cannot promise is that the extra fights will look like the
 * ones already counted, and the flat simulator allowance is a floor no sample
 * size gets under — asking for a band tighter than that is refused rather than
 * answered with a number that would never arrive.
 *
 * ## Why the damage figure is taken apart
 *
 * "Your damage is 9% under the prediction" is where the check used to stop, and
 * it is one sentence short of useful: 9% under could be swinging less often,
 * landing a smaller share of swings, or hitting for less when they land, and
 * those are three completely different bugs. Damage per second is the product of
 * exactly those three, and **both sides genuinely carry all three** — the
 * attribution already counts hits and misses off the feed, and the simulator's
 * `attacks` map is a histogram of every swing it made, keyed by the damage it
 * did or by `miss`. So the headline gets decomposed, and each factor gets its
 * own noise band.
 *
 * Only the swings both sides mean the same thing by are counted: auto-attacks
 * and abilities. The simulator also records bleeds, thorns, retaliation and
 * parries through the same map, and none of those is a swing the attribution
 * would see as one — a bleed moves health without moving the hit counter, which
 * is precisely why the attribution ignores it.
 *
 * What is **not** compared, because only one side has it: crits (the simulator's
 * histogram records damage, not whether the roll crit), and the distribution of
 * fight lengths (the simulator reports a total time and an encounter count, so
 * its time-to-kill is a mean and there is nothing to put percentiles against).

/**
 * Labyrinth run ledger
 *
 * What each run left unspent. The Consumables panel plans a run as full
 * consumption of the whole torch/shroud/beacon capacity — the honest ceiling —
 * but the interesting question afterwards is the opposite one: how much came
 * back. A run that keeps ending with two hundred torches to spare is a run
 * whose "rush for exit" floor could come down (rushing fewer floors means
 * fully clearing more of them, and a full clear costs a floor's whole grid in
 * torches where a rush costs one path across it).
 *
 * So every run's ending is recorded: the last supply counts the run reported
 * before it ended, the deepest floor it reached, and when. A bounded ring,
 * character-scoped, in the labyrinth store.
 *
 * The transition detection mirrors labyrinth-run-alerts, including its two
 * traps: a payload that says nothing about the run is not evidence the run
 * ended, and the server re-sends labyrinth messages after a run ends, so each
 * ending is keyed by the run's own start stamp and recorded once.
 *
 * ## The grid arithmetic
 *
 * From the game's own guide: floor 1 is a 4×4 grid, each floor one wider, to
 * 8×8 at floor 5 and beyond; entry at one corner, exit at the opposite. A
 * torch is spent per room entered, so a full clear costs the grid squared and
 * a rush costs the shortest corner-to-corner path — one room per step,
 * (g−1)+(g−1)+1 rooms. Those two figures per floor are what the rush-floor
 * advisor sums.

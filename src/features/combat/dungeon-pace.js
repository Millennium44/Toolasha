 * Dungeon pace

 *
 * The comparison is per wave rather than per run because a run in progress has
 * no duration yet, and projecting one would be a guess stacked on a guess. The
 * wave average is a thing both sides genuinely have: the live run measures its
 * waves directly, and a stored run's duration divided by the dungeon's wave
 * count is its wave average — every saved run finished, or it would not have
 * been saved.
 *
 * Stored runs recorded from chat carry no tier, so the history is matched on
 * dungeon name, and a run whose tier *is* stated only counts when it matches.
 * No history means no chip — a pace against nothing is not a pace.

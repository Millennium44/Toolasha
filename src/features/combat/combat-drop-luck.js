/**
 * Combat Drop Luck
 *
 * Puts a percentile on a combat session's takings, in the battle panel beside the
 * revenue figure that prompts the question.
 *
 * Revenue on its own cannot answer "was that bad, or was that just Tuesday?".
 * A zone's average tells you nothing about its spread, and the zones people
 * actually grind are the ones with a rare drop carrying most of the value — where
 * the median session is well under average and a single lucky hour is worth a
 * day. This says where the session sits: 50 is exactly typical, 5 means
 * nineteen sessions in twenty do better.
 *
 * The maths is in `utils/drop-luck.js` and the zone modelling in
 * `utils/combat-drop-model.js`; this module only decides when to ask and where to
 * put the answer.
 *
 * It is asked twice. The battle panel gets it on `battle_unit_fetched`, which is
 * the moment you leave combat and see the revenue it sits beside. The overlay
 * row wants it during the run, so the figure is also recomputed from the running
 * loot total on `new_battle` — throttled, because the transform costs about a
 * tenth of a second and battles can be seconds apart.
 *
 * Two limits worth knowing, both shown rather than hidden:
 *
 * - **Dungeons get a different question.** They pay from a reward table on
 *   completion, not per monster, so the per-monster model declines to measure
 *   one. What a dungeon *can* be asked is how many chests it paid against how
 *   many it owed — the Combat Drop Quantity bonus is the whole of the randomness
 *   in a dungeon payout — and `utils/dungeon-chest-luck.js` answers that instead.
 * - **Unpriced drops are left out of both sides.** An item with no market price is
 *   dropped from the model and from the session's income, so the comparison stays
 *   like for like.

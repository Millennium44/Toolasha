# MWITools (adaptation notes)

Notes on **MWITools v26.4.17** by **bot7420, shykai and Stella** — the long-running

The script is **not kept here**; see `LICENSE.md` beside this file for the licence it declares
and for the statement that portions were adapted and modified. What follows is the record of
which portions, what Toolasha does with them, and where.

## What was adapted

- **The `market_item_values_updated` subscription.** MWITools routes that WebSocket message to
  an `applyMarketItemValues` handler that swaps `marketValuesVersion` and `marketItemValues`
  wholesale and marks its valuation caches dirty. Toolasha read the same map only out of
  localStorage through the game's own util, on a 30-second throttle, so a mid-session value
  refresh left every consumer of the official values — networth's `officialValue` source, the
  tradable-band clamp — up to that long stale, and stale for the whole session if the game
  writes the blob only once. The message is now handled in `src/core/data-manager.js` and
  applied in `src/utils/market-values.js`, which swaps the cached map, bumps the cached version
  and drops the derived band cache. Toolasha's own structure otherwise: its cache, its
  band derivation, its event bus. What was taken is the knowledge that the message exists and
  the shape of its payload.
- **The header anchor selectors.** MWITools anchors a header warning against
  `div[class*="Header_actionInfo"]` and measures around `div[class*="Header_communityBuffs"]`.
  Neither appeared anywhere in Toolasha. Both are now in the canary selector list in
  `src/entrypoint.js`, so a game refactor of the header is reported through
  `UI.healthStatus.reportFailures` like every other anchor Toolasha depends on. Taken: the two
  selector strings. Everything around them is Toolasha's existing canary machinery.
- **Locale-aware thousands/decimal separator detection.** MWITools derives the game's number
  separators from `Intl.NumberFormat(locale).formatToParts(1111.1)`, with the locale taken from
  the game's own `i18nextLng` localStorage key rather than from the browser — the game's
  language setting and the browser's need not agree, and the game formats its numbers by the
  former. Toolasha had been stripping separators with a hardcoded `replace(/,/g, '')`, which
  silently mis-parses every comma-decimal locale (`1,5` reads back as 15). The detection is
  adapted in `parseGameNumber` / `gameNumberSeparators` in `src/utils/number-parser.js`, with an
  attribution line in the JSDoc; the parsing built on top of it, and the call sites, are
  Toolasha's. `formatters.js` was the obvious home but the wrong one: `number-parser.js`
  already exists for exactly this — reading a number back out of text the game drew — and
  `parseGameNumber` is the locale-driven sibling of the `parseItemCount` heuristic there.

- **The ability→effect index and the buff/debuff bars.** MWITools' `battleBuffs` builds an
  index at boot of which buffs and debuffs each ability applies and to whom, seeds per-unit
  state from the combatant list on `new_battle`, and reconciles it against the buff maps on
  `battle_updated`, drawing an icon strip with countdowns beneath every unit. Toolasha's version
  is `src/utils/ability-effects.js` (the index, identity-cached like its other boot-time
  indexes) and `src/features/combat/combat-unit-buff-bars.js` (the strips, seated in the unit
  tile the way `portrait-dps.js` already does). Two deliberate departures: buff-versus-debuff
  is decided by the effect's target, not its type, because a debuff arrives as a damage effect
  whose buffs land on the target; and MWITools' HP-delta inference of pending effects was not
  taken, since it would paint a debuff on a monster that resisted. Setting `combatUnitBuffBars`.
- **The equipment mismatch warning.** MWITools' `checkEquipment` shows a header pill when
  skilling gear is worn into combat or a production action runs while its efficiency piece sits
  unequipped, checking four pieces against their action families and suppressing itself during
  a labyrinth run. Toolasha's `src/features/equipment/equipment-mismatch-warning.js` keeps the
  four rules but verifies each against the item's own `equipmentDetail` at runtime and skips a
  rule the data does not confirm — which is how the enchanted gloves' enhancing bonus turned out
  to be speed, not efficiency. The running action comes from `runningAction()`, never from the
  queue's first entry. Setting `equipmentMismatchWarning`.
- **The guided walk through a crafting chain.** MWITools' `semiAutoTrain` walks an upgrade chain
  one stop at a time: it navigates to each stop's action, pre-fills the count, listens for the
  player's own press on the game's queue button, and — for a stop bought from the shop — waits on
  an inventory change instead. Toolasha's `src/features/crafting-plan/crafting-plan-walk.js` walks
  the steps of its own buy-vs-craft plan (`crafting-plan-calculator.js`) rather than an upgrade
  chain, leaves first and merged where two branches share an intermediate, and confirms a step
  from the server's `actions_updated` naming that step's action rather than from a DOM click
  listener — the same contract the task reroll walk already keeps, and the reason nothing here is
  ever chained. The buy branch opens the marketplace, not the shop. Setting
  `craftingPlan_guidedWalk`.
- **Walking several tasks that share a crafting chain as one.** MWITools' `taskTrainPlanner`
  buckets the task board by chain: it takes each task's output, walks the linear upgrade chain up
  to its root, and groups every task sharing that root so one train covers them all. Toolasha's
  `src/features/crafting-plan/task-crafting-train.js` takes the idea and not the mechanism — a
  Toolasha plan is a tree with several inputs per node and buy-vs-craft decided per leg, so there
  is no single chain root to bucket on. It plans each task's target separately, merges the
  resulting walk step lists on the step key with the counts summed, and rebuilds the order as a
  topological sort of every plan's dependency edges, so a step feeding two tasks still precedes
  both. Tasks are grouped as connected components over "shares at least one craft step", which
  does not depend on which task the board lists first, and a merged walk claims its materials
  under one owner id so a shared material is reserved once. The walk itself is reused unchanged.
  Setting `tasks_mergedCraftingWalk`.

- **The shared inventory reservation ledger.** MWITools' `procurementAssistant` keeps a cart of
  plans and answers `getEffectiveInventory(itemHrid, level, excludePlanId)` — what is held less
  every OTHER plan's locked materials — so two plans cannot both count the same stock. Toolasha
  computed its shortfalls in five places, each against the whole bag and none aware of the others.
  The ledger is `src/utils/inventory-reservations.js`, wired into the goal planner, the crafting
  plan, the missing-materials tabs, the budget calculator and the sell queue, behind the
  default-off `inventoryReservations` setting. Taken: the idea that a plan's claim is written down
  and that the asking plan excludes itself. Toolasha's own: the owner-id model (any plan, panel or
  queue rather than a cart entry), the per-character persisted record and its per-owner
  newer-wins sync fold, orphan release for owners a consumer can enumerate plus a stated TTL for
  those it cannot, the sell queue as an owner that releases stock rather than planning to spend
  it, and the visibility line that names which plan holds the stock. **Not taken:** the cart UI —
  MWITools' plan list, its progress bars and its add-to-cart flow have no counterpart here; a
  claim is made by the plan that already exists, never authored. Also not taken: its
  `getProjectReservedInventory`/allocation-snapshot reporting surface, and its
  `excludeActionHrids` filter, which exists for that cart's own bookkeeping. Toolasha's
  `actions_artisanMaterialMode` already handles the tea-rounding half of the same problem, and was
  left alone.

- **Leaderboard rank badges.** MWITools' `leaderboard-overlay` (v1.4.1) draws a pill beside
  character names with the game's skill sprite and a top-100 rank, in four tier bands, fed by the
  game's `leaderboard_updated` message and by a third-party data server polled every 15 minutes.
  Toolasha's `src/features/leaderboard/leaderboard-rank-badges.js` and
  `src/utils/rank-badge-data.js` take the design — tiers, pill, the standard/ironcow pair, best-rank
  choice, the server's response shape and endpoint — and no code. Departures: one select setting
  (`leaderboardRankBadges`, default Off) chooses between nothing, local rows only, and the server;
  one badge per name with the other ranks in its tooltip, each with the age of its snapshot; the
  server response is parsed as untrusted and only ever written with `textContent`; cached through
  the storage module with a per-board newer-wins merge that also serves cross-device sync. The host
  is declared in `@connect` in both header files. **Not taken:** the leaderboard XP/hour rate
  column (Toolasha has its own) and the custom icon base URL.

## What was not adapted

- **MWITools' own market API.** Its value handling sits beside a fetch of a third-party market
  price API with its own caching, fallback host and local backup blob. Toolasha prices from the
  game's own order books and official values and does not fetch an external price feed.
- **Its config and settings model.** The separator detection was taken out of MWITools' config
  module; the settings map it lives in, and the script-wide `isZH` language switch beside it,
  were not.
